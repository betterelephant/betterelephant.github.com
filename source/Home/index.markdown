*Better Elephant* is a community-led campaign seeking to improve the regeneration of the Elephant & Castle.

Our campaign is a response to the recently-revealed masterplan proposals for the area. We feel that the current plans have been shaped according to private interests and not to the benefit of the community.

Our aim is to oppose the current top-down scheme and propose a bottom-up scheme created by and for the community.

Our proposals are categorised as follows:

**Housing**-> The 1,200 empty homes on the Heygate estate to be purchased and refurbished by the community, under the new 'Community Right to Buy' created by the new Localism Act. [Read more....](http://betterelephant.org/Housing)

**Transport**-> Removal of the northern roundabout as part of a car-free pedestrian and cyclist friendly development with a 20mph speed limit.    

**Environment**-> Creation of public park within Heygate urban forest. Installation of biomass boiler powering the current district-heating system.
