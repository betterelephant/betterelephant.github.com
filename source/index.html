  <p><strong>Better Elephant</strong> is a community-led campaign seeking to improve the regeneration of the Elephant &amp; Castle.</p>

<p>Our campaign is a response to the recently-revealed masterplan proposals for the area. We feel that the current plans have been shaped according to private interests and not to the benefit of the community.</p>

<p>Our aim is to propose a bottom-up regeneration scheme created by and for the community.</p>

<p>Our proposals are categorised as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Housing</strong>-> The community purchases and refurbishes the 1,200 empty homes on the Heygate estate from the council under the new &#8216;Community Right to Buy&#8217; created by the new Localism Act. <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Housing">Read more&#8230;.</a></p>

<p><strong>Transport</strong>-> Removal of the northern roundabout as part of a car-free pedestrian and cyclist friendly development with a 20mph speed limit.</p>

<p><strong>Environment</strong>-> Creation of public park within Heygate urban forest. Installation of biomass boiler powering the current district-heating system.</p>

<p>We don't want to see a vast area of public-owned land and buildings at the E&C sold at a discount to a private developer, who is planning to demolish and cram in as many badly-designed and badly-built towers as possible for the private benefit of a few. We want to see these public commons regenerated to the benefit of the community, who we are inviting to engage in shaping the space which they own and inhabit.</p>

<p>The Localism Act, which received Royal Assent on November 15 2011, introduced new rights and powers to allow local communities to shape new developments by coming together to prepare <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/inyourarea/neighbourhood/"><em>neighbourhood plans</em></a>. The <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com">Elephant Amenity Network</a> has formed a <em>neighbourhood forum</em> and is preparing a <em>neighbourhood plan</em> for the Elephant & Castle based on the <strong>Better Elephant</strong> proposals.</p>

<p>If you support our plan for regeneration you can sign our petition, or if you would like to get involved - we meet on the 3rd Tuesday of every month at Browning Street Community Hall at 7pm.</p>
