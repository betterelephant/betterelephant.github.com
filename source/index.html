<h2><strong>BETTER ELEPHANT</strong> is a community-led campaign seeking to improve the regeneration of the Elephant &amp; Castle.</h2>
</br>
</br>
<p>Our campaign is a response to the current masterplan proposals for the area. The local community has raised a number of significant concerns involving <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Housing">housing</a>, <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Environmental">environmental</a> and <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Financial">financing</a> issues:
</p>
<p> 
<strong>Housing-></strong> The significant planned reduction in family-size homes and housing for people on low incomes, with the cheapest of the new affordable homes starting at Â£275 per week.<a href="http://betterelephant.org/Housing"> Read more..</a> 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Environmental-></strong> The loss of a significant number of trees and green space, and the potentially devastating carbon impact of the current scheme. <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Environmental">Read more..</a></p>

<p>
<strong>Financing-></strong> The current scheme's financial impact on council funds at a time of unprecedented budget cuts. <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Financial">Read more..</a>
</p>
	
<p>We believe that the current plans are unimaginative and shaped solely according the interests of private stakeholders. <strong>We think that the community can do a much better job in creating a truly Better Elephant</strong>. Our vision of a community-led regeneration run by local residents, artists, businesses and community groups, will engage the local community in shaping the space they inhabit, and transform the Elephant into a unique and vibrant creative hub.</p> 

<p>The new Localism Act, which was passed on November 15 2011, introduced new rights and powers to allow local communities to shape local planning law by coming together to prepare <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/inyourarea/neighbourhood/"><em>neighbourhood plans</em></a>.</p> 

<p><strong>Better Elephant</strong> is preparing a <em>neighbourhood plan</em> for the Elephant & Castle, which considers alternatives to demolition of the Heygate estate and the provision of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> A new library</strong></li>
<li><strong> A new school (city academy)</strong></li>
<li><strong> A science museum</strong></li>
<li><strong> A mobility centre</strong></li>
<li><strong> A new railway station concourse</strong></li>
<li><strong> Enhanced primary healthcare facilities</strong></li>
<li><strong> A new healthy living centre</strong></li>
<li><strong> A MUSCo (Multi-utilities services company) to provide heat, power, 'green' water and data services for the entire area.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>{% img right http://betterelephant.org/images/elephant.jpg %}The original regenration plans were drawn up on the basis that the Elephant was over-dominated by its road layout and was unfriendly to pedestrians. The original 2004 masterplan intended to demolish the shopping centre, and pedestrianise the northern roundabout by turning it into a civic square. The current developers Lend Lease, have dropped these proposals from their masterplan and appear wholly uninterested in improving the public amenity infrastructure of the Elephant; they seem to want to simply cram as many homes as they can on surrounding bits of land. 
</p>

<p>We don't think that this is in the interest of the current or future community at the Elephant and Castle, and are currently in the process of drafting our own vision based on some of the proposals made in the original 2004 masterplan (<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/82420796/Southwark-Council-2004-Development-Framework">[view online]</a> or <a href="http://elephantamenity.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/framework.pdf">[download here])</a>, along with the recommendations made in <a href="http://heygate.heroku.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey">[this 1998 council-commissioned appraisal study]</a>. We think the community can do a <strong>better</strong> job and make a <strong>BETTER ELEPHANT!</strong> 
</p>

<p>Local residents and key professionals who are interested in the future of our neighbourhood and city, are invited to get involved and share in our inspiring vision of the future.</p>
