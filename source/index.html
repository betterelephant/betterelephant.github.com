<h3> <p><em>'Better Elephant'</em> is a community-led campaign seeking to improve the regeneration of the Elephant &amp; Castle.</p> </h3>

<p>Our campaign is a response to the recently-revealed masterplan proposals for the area. We believe that the current developer-led plans - which are based on private interest profit - will result in characterless streets with a bland retail offer, overshadowed by monotonous high-rise blocks.</p>
	
<p>Our vision of a community-led regeneration run by local residents, artists, businesses and community groups, will engage the local community in shaping the space they inhabit, and transform the Elephant into a unique and vibrant creative hub.</p> 

<p>The Localism Act, which received Royal Assent on November 15 2011, introduced new rights and powers to allow local communities to shape new developments by coming together to prepare <a href="http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/inyourarea/neighbourhood/"><em>neighbourhood plans</em></a>. <strong>Better Elephant</strong> has formed a <em>neighbourhood forum</em> and is preparing a <em>neighbourhood plan</em> for the Elephant & Castle based on the following proposals.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Housing</strong>-> The community purchases and refurbishes the 1,200 empty homes on the Heygate estate from Southwark council under the new &#8216;Community Right to Buy&#8217; scheme created by the new Localism Act. <a href="http://betterelephant.org/Housing">Read more&#8230;.</a></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Transport</strong>-> The community develops plans for the removal of the northern roundabout, as part of a car-free pedestrian and cyclist friendly development with a 20mph speed limit.<a href="http://betterelephant.org/Transport">Read more&#8230;</a></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Environment</strong>-> The creation of a public park within the footprint of the Heygate estate, building on the existing <a href="http://elephantandcastleurbanforest.com">E&C Urban Forest campaign</a>. Installation of a biomass boiler powering the current district-heating system.<a href="http://betterelephant.org/Environmental">Read more&#8230;</a></p></li>
</ul>
