The Heygate estate was already [sold by Southwark council on Friday 23rd July 2010](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/193/elephant_regeneration_agreement_formally_signed) to an Australian company called 'Lend Lease'. Perhaps this is why Southwark council was so quick to remove the 'For Sale' sign, in order to avoid a rush of enquiries from people wishing to buy a home on the Heygate.- Although I think there might still be a [couple of leaseholders](http://halag.wordpress.com) on the Heygate still willing to sell up..[{%img left http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6820425150_77a0988bc7_m.jpg %}](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6820425150_77a0988bc7_z.jpg)

The details of the agreement, i.e. the sale price have not been disclosed by Southwark council. It is claiming that the sale price is 'commercially sensitive' information and therefore cannot be made public. One of the opposition councillors disagreed with this decision and tried to make some of the details public. She was quickly silenced when the labour administration [took legal action to have her censured](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5869). This is the first time in the history of Southwark council that a councillor has been censured. One might be forgiven for asking why the council are so keen to avoid the details of its deal with Lend Lease entering the public realm? Could it be something to do with Lend Lease's track record for securing public handouts?:
