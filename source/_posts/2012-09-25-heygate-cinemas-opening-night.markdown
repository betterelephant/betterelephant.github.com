    Following a spate of <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/unauthorised_activities.pdf">attempts to stifle its interim use programme</a> last year, this year Better Elephant decided to create a pop-up cinema, which can be popped up and then quickly popped down again.</p>

Around 50 people attended the opening night of the &#39;pop-up&#39; cinema last Saturday 22 Sep, for the premiere&nbsp;screening of the film ['Doreen'](http://youtu.be/CnkVzJXibyI) made by film-makers David Reeve &amp; Patrick Steel.


In the film, Doreen Gee - former Chair of the Tenants &amp; Residents Association - reminisces about the culture of the estate and what went wrong with the regeneration.

Doreen and both of the film-makers attended the event, which was followed by an animated discussion around the regeneration and wider housing issues. The audience included a number of former Heygate residents and residents from the neighbouring Aylesbury estate, who were treated to a bowl of hot soup and refreshments following the lively discussion.

<p>
    During the discussion, Doreen - who had originally been a strong propenent of the regeneration - spoke about the broken promises of new homes for residents of the estate and how many were forced into unsuitable accommodation much further afield. She also claimed she had been victimised after speaking out against the regeneration.</p>


<p>
    The film was accompanied by a number of newsclips about the estate and an excerpt from the film-makers&rsquo; new feature-length documentary about the regeneration of the estate (Larry &amp; Janet). Film-makers David Reeve and Patrick Steel from <a href="http://kingchainproductions.com/">Kingchain Productions</a> have been filming on the estate since the decant started, and have inspired the confidence of residents past and present. They are due to release a feature length documentary about the estate in Autumn 2013.&nbsp;</p>

    Three days after the event, four council officers turned up - including <a href="/blog/2012/08/06/offensive-graffiti-removed/">Graffiti afficionado Andrew Ashaye</a> - to deliver the notice pictured below. </p>

{% img left http://alicecalcagno.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_9857-2.jpg 400 300 %}Fortunately, the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/space">Better Elephant group</a> was able to hastily pop-down the pop-up cinema on Wednesday evening before any harm came to it. The cinema will now be &#39;popped up&#39; on an ad-hoc unannounced basis when it is least expected. The next film to be screened is Michael Wadleigh&#39;s 1981 film - &#39;Wolfen&#39;: a cautionary metaphor about real estate speculation, urban gentrification, homeless displacement and all the disturbing human-caused destruction that threatens people&rsquo;s communities and the ecosystems we all share.

This marks the opening of the Heygate&#39;s new &#39;Hotel Elephant&#39; - an art space funded by development-partner Lend Lease, in which some of the asbestos-riddled former community facilities on the estate are being converted to swanky artist studios. Now that the feckless undesirables have been removed from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19371334">'unpopular social housing' estate</a>, the drab interiors of the former community centre are being converted to plush artist studios for a far more deserving new gentrified community. &nbsp;</p>


{% img left http://www.elefest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/flame-classic.jpg 400 300 %}Providing that none of the contractors come down with asbestos poisoning from the refitting works, the studios&#39;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elefest.org/event/hotel-elephant-launch/">will open on the 6th October with</a> a performance by a wasteful gas-powered firebreathing robotic dragon.</br> Welcome to London&#39;s greenest regeneration scheme...

{% img right http://betterelephant.github.com/images/mrstilki.jpg 400 300 %}Meanwhile two of the remaining households on the estate - about to be <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">forcibly displaced</a> - include pensioners in their seventies & eighties. Since the council <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,19279,185,00.htm">switched their heating off</a> in 2010, the Mustafa family and the Tilki family have been sat at home covered in blankets huddled around a portable electric fan heater - whilst artists and revellers gather around the spectacle of a fire-breathing dragon in the estate's former community hall. </br>Welcome to London's most inequitable regeneration scheme and most brazen example of Gentrification at its worst.&nbsp;
