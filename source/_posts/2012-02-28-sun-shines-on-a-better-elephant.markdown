{% img left /images/southwarknewsBEarticle.jpg %}The sun was shining on our [Better Elephant exhibition](http://betterelephant.org/images/BetterElephantFlyer.png) at the Heygate estate on Saturday. Over 100 people turned out in the spring-like sunshine, to view our [neighbourhood planning](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/introductionneighbourplanning) proposal for an alternative regeneration plan at the Elephant & Castle. The exhibition is a response to the current masterplan for the area, which was released to the public last week, and which offers an alternative vision for the Elephant & Castle area.{% img right http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7183/6934528321_ec11c8611e_m.jpg %}

Our exhibition discussed the existing proposals and compared them to the Better Elephant plan, which included the following:

</br>

* Ideas for refurbishment of some of the existing homes
* Retention of the urban forest of 450 mature trees
* Wind turbines located on high-rise blocks
* Green roofs and food-growing spaces
* Conversion of existing district heating system boiler to biomass

They were out in force preparing for the coming growing season, and inviting other local residents to get involved. The group have begun planting herbs and vegetables in old recycling containers in various location throughout the disused housing estate. Any local residents who are interested in starting their own mobile gardens are [invited to get involved](http://betterelephant.org/space).  

After the success of the event, the exhibition's display boards will remain in place providing a hub for further information and consultation.
