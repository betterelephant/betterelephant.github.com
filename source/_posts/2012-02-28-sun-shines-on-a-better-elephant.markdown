Over 100 people turned out in the spring-like sunshine, to view our [neighbourhood planning](http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/introductionneighbourplanning) proposal for an alternative regeneration plan. The exhibition is a response to the current masterplan for the area, which was released to the public last week, and which offers an alternative vision of regeneration at the Elephant & Castle.

After the success of the event, we are planning to leave the exhibition's display boards up for a further two weeks until 15th March.

They were out in force preparing for the coming growing season, and inviting other local residents to get involved. The group have begun planting herbs and vegetables in old recycling containers in various location throughout the disused housing estate. Any local residents who are interested in starting their own mobile gardens are [invited to get involved](http://betterelephant.org/space).
