Better Elephant gardeners have received praise for their 'blooming beautiful' efforts in a [press release](http://www.veoliaenvironmentalservices.co.uk/Southwark/About-us/News/Press-releases/Grow-your-own-in-the-old-blue-box/) by Southwark contractors Veolia today.

The team were mentioned alongside the Pembroke Gardens community gardening project for having made creative use of the council's old recycling boxes, which have now been replaced with a new design.

The team include former Heygate residents the Uddin family, who also manage the nearby 'Ivory Arch' Indian restaurant. The project has involved researchers in urban agriculture from UCL (University College London) and is exploring the potential for [local food sourcing to supply local demand](http://www.ruaf.org/sites/default/files/UAM22%20London%2037-38.pdf).
