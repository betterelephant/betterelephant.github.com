Last week's [international property fair __MIPIM__](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/yacht-cannes-selling-homes-local-government-officials-mipim) wasn't just for developers and councils, it was also for those who help developers lobby councils. [__Four Communications__](https://www.fourcommunications.com/) is one such company. It says it offers teams of experts who _"provide support at every stage of the planning, marketing and communications process"_ and helps to secure [_"political support in the face of public opposition"_](https://www.fourcommunications.com/work-gallery/helping-secure-new-community-stadium).

Who are these 'experts' able to magically gain the 'political support' of council members in developments facing public opposition?  Well, who better than council members themselves?

{% img left http://www.fourcommunications.com/sites/default/files/styles/four_square/public/people/jeremy.png?itok=IDqYOvmA %}__Four Communications__ was [founded](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm) in 2001 by former (Labour) Southwark council leader Jeremy Fraser. On its payroll and [list of shareholders](/images/OneStopReport.pdf) are former (Labour) Lambeth council leader [Jim Dickson](http://www.fourcommunications.com/who-we-are/our-people/jim-dickson) (who is also a [sitting Lambeth councillor](http://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=165)) and Southwark's former (Labour) Cabinet Member for Regeneration Steve Lancashire<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>. 

The South Bank's King's Reach Tower provides a good example of how __Four Communications__' lobbying service works. In 2010, Developer [__CIT__](http://www.cit.co.uk/) employed __Four__ to 'help' get permission for its controversial 41 storey Blackfriars development. This is how __Four__'s 4 step lobbying process was implemented:

1. __Four__'s Steve Lancashire sets up meetings with his Southwark Labour cronies Peter John (council leader) and Fiona Colley (Cabinet Member for Regeneration).

2. The old friends agree to nod through the development despite its numerous planning policy breaches like the lack of any on-site affordable housing. 
3. The council leader and regen boss brief their planning officers instructing them to recommend the application to the (heavily whipped) planning committee.
4. __Four__ conducts a bogus consultation and produces a ['Statement of Community Involvement'](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/152101_1.pdf), providing phony evidence that local residents support the application.    



Every major planning application requires a Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) to demonstrate that the developer has consulted with the local community and that its plans have public support. __Four__ has helped developers obtain permission and produced SCIs for an impressive list of (social housing-free) developments in Southwark. The table below provides links to the SCIs created by __Four__ for each of the following developments which it helped obtain permission:

[{% imgcap right http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/StrataSCI.png 370 350 See page 19 of Strata Tower SCI %}](http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/15810_1.pdf)Another working example is Strata Tower, which shows what a sham __Four__'s SCI consultation process is: its consultation showed that it had consulted just 13 people - hardly evidence of widespread public support. Unsurprisingly most of these agreed to the vague and narrowly-framed questions aimed at restricting any kind of meaningful consultation:

* _"The design of the scheme should be of the highest quality"_
* _"Any new proposals should be environmentally friendly"_
* _"It is important that local residents continue to be consulted as plans move forward"_

The planning application was duly nodded through and Strata Tower - entirely without social rented housing but complete with useless wind turbines - was built.  

__Four__'s links with Southwark's political leaders are not just limited to the Southwark Labour party, it is also a [member](http://www.teamlondonbridge.co.uk/businessdirectorydetails.aspx?ref=6051) of the __Team London Bridge__ Business Improvement District where its office is located, of which Southwark Regen boss Fiona Colley is [a Director](http://www.teamlondonbridge.co.uk/default.aspx?m=3&mi=272&ms=103). 

As covered in a [previous post](http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/04/09/report-uncovers-corruption-at-the-elephant/), Southwark's former Lib Dem and Conservative leaders have shown no greater integrity and are both now helping developers obtain planning permission for developments in Southwark. What makes the Labour leaders' double-dealing particularly treacherous is their political strangleholds in Southwark and Lambeth. The lack of any opposition party provides the leaders with a free hand to wave all these developments through unscrutinised. 

Southwark and Lambeth's corrupt Labour clique has given a whole new meaning to the New Labour mantra of __"inclusive prosperity"__.
