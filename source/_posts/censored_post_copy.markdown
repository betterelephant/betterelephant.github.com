In April 2012, Building Trust International launched the [HOME competition](http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/homecompetition.html) - a project focused on providing residents most at risk in developed cities with a safe place to live. The competition's task was to create an urban dwelling for under £20k, and it resulted in over 450 applications.  


One of the applications was a marvellous joint entry from [Gensler](http://www.gensler.com/), a global architecture consulting firm and [Baqus](http://www.baqus.co.uk), a multinational construction consultancy. With the aid of data collated by the Better Elephant team, Gensler and Baqus produced a wonderful report showing how it could be possible to refurbish the Heygate estate for less than it had cost to empty it.  

[{%img left http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/images/gensler.jpg %}](http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/homecompetition.html)With the permission of Gensler, one of its presentation slides was uploaded for display on the Better Elephant website.   

However, it would appear that a certain well-known Australian property developer has flexed its monopolistic muscles, and this week Better Elephant received a request to remove the presentation slides from its website.

[The Gensler & Baqus proposals](http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/homepros/16272.pdf) showed how the Heygate could be refurbished at a cost of just £14,000 per home on the estate. Being just marginally above the £13,000 grant available under the [HCA Empty Homes Grants Programme](http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/empty-homes), one can see why the proposals are interesting to Better Elephant but wouldn't be to a certain Australian property developer with thousands of empty buildings sitting in its UK [land bank](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/nicky-gavron/the-planning-system-isnt-_b_1869861.html).

{% img right http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/12/1352720042109/homeless1.jpg %}The Gensler & Baqus entry won an honourable mention, but the winner of the competition was architect consultancy Levitt Bernstein with its ['pop-up' garage proposal](http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/nov/12/garages-housing-homeless-people) which would allow an 11.5sq m bedsit to be created within a disused garage for around £13,000.   
</br>
With over 1,000 garages on the Heygate estate this would double the number of homes on the site without any structural modifications. We wonder if Levitt Bernstein will be putting forward this proposal in [its masterplan](http://www.levittbernstein.co.uk/urban-design/masterplanning/) for the neighbouring Aylesbury estate regeneration..
