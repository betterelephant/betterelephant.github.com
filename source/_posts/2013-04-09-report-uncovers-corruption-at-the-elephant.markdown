A [report](http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/component/k2/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy) by [journalist Anna Minton](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/27/reconfiguration-london-akin-social-cleansing) has uncovered conflicts of interest and what she describes as a revolving door between council officials and developers at the Elephant & Castle.

The report reveals a number of former council officers involved in negotiations with developer Lend Lease for the [controversial sale](http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/02/southwark-council-accidentally-leaks-confidential-information-about-controversial-heygate-re) of the Heygate estate, who have left the council and are now full-time employees of Lend Lease corporation.
