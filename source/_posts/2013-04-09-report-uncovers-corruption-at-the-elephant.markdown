With the [recent disclosure](http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/02/04/council-accidentally-publishes-confidential-regeneration-agreement/) that the council will be making a loss on the sale of the Heygate site while Lend Lease are [predicted to make a £194m profit](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/CILviabilitysite11.pdf) from its purchase, questions are starting to be asked about conflicts of interest and integrity of those responsible for acting in the council's best interest.
