A [report](http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/component/k2/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy) by [journalist Anna Minton](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/27/reconfiguration-london-akin-social-cleansing) has uncovered conflicts of interest and what she describes as a revolving door between council officials and developers at the Elephant & Castle.

The report reveals a number of former council officers involved in negotiations with developer Lend Lease for the [controversial sale](http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/02/southwark-council-accidentally-leaks-confidential-information-about-controversial-heygate-re) of the Heygate estate, who have left the council and are now full-time employees of Lend Lease Plc.

Beyond the Council's senior planning & regeneration team officers who have defected to the private development sector, a more than significant number of Council members have also slinked through Southwark's revolving doors:

{% img left http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/uploads/Jeremy-Frasernew-152x203.jpg %}After Labour lost to the Lib Dems in 2002, both the former Labour Council Leader (Jeremy Fraser - left), Southwark's Councillor for Regeneration (Steve Lancashire) and Lambeth's [Jim Dickson](http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=165) decided to [set up a consultancy](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm) together advising developers on real-estate developments. Their company is called ['Four Communications'](http://www.fourcommunications.com/) and one of its main clients is [CIT Developments](http://www.cit.co.uk/). Four Communications is currently advising CIT on a number of developments in the borough, including the controversial ['King's Reach Tower'](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6890) scheme. Fraser was Council Leader in 1997 when he sold the 13-acre council-owned 'More London' site at Tower Bridge to CIT [for just £65.5million](http://www.cit.co.uk/developments/case-studies/19). Today the site houses the GLA Headquarters and is valued at around £2bn. Another of Four Communication's clients is Oakmayne Plc, which it is advising on its controversial [Eileen House](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15741925) development. 'Four' has also assisted developers obtain planning permission on the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6890">King's Reach Tower</a>, <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/7387">'One Blackfriars'</a>, <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5356">'Neo-Bankside'</a>, <a href="http://www.ludgateandsampson.com/">Ludgate & Sampson House</a> and the Shard - none of which provide any on-site affordable housing.

With the [recent disclosure](http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/02/04/council-accidentally-publishes-confidential-regeneration-agreement/) that the council will be making a loss on the sale of the Heygate site while Lend Lease are [predicted to make a £194m profit](http://affordable.heroku.com/images/CILviabilitysite11.pdf) from its purchase, questions are starting to be asked about conflicts of interest and integrity of those supposed to be acting in the council's best interest.
