A [report](http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/component/k2/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy) by [journalist Anna Minton](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/27/reconfiguration-london-akin-social-cleansing) has uncovered conflicts of interest and what she describes as a revolving door between council officials and developers at the Elephant & Castle.

The report reveals a number of former council officers involved in negotiations with developer Lend Lease for the [controversial sale](http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/02/southwark-council-accidentally-leaks-confidential-information-about-controversial-heygate-re) of the Heygate estate, who have left the council and are now full-time employees of Lend Lease corporation.

Beyond the Council's senior planning & regeneration team officers who have defected to the private development sector, a more than significant number of Council members have also slinked through Southwark's revolving doors:

With [controversy](http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/) mounting about the deals being done with developers in Southwark, serious questions are starting to be asked about conflicts of interest and integrity of those supposed to be acting in the council's best interest.
