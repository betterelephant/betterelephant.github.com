The remaining residents on the Heygate estate have submitted their objection to the forthcoming Compulsory Purchase Order public inquiry.

The public inquiry has been called in order for the Secretary of State to establish whether the public benefits of the development proposals sufficiently outweigh remaining residents' rights to their homes.

__Core Proposals Shelved__
Heygate residents will talk about the core component of the Elephant & Castle scheme, which was the demolition of the shopping centre, roundabout and link road in order to create a new civic square the size of trafalgar square. This was going to tackle the car-dominated layout of the area, and link up the public transport connections. 

Now that the civic square has been dropped and the shopping centre is set for refurbishment after negotiations with the owners broke down, the group will be arguing that the scheme is simply a commercial development with little to no public benefit.

They will also be pointing out that many of the other key public benefits listed in the original proposals have also been scrapped, including: 
* a new arts and cultural facility;
* a new performance square;
* a new theatre;
* a new science museum;
* a new library;
* new civic offices;
* a new secondary school;
* a renewable energy plant providing green energy and sustainable water to 10,000 homes.
[(see original proposals here..)](http://www.scribd.com/doc/82420796/Southwark-Council-2004-Development-Framework)

And pointing out the shortcomings of the current proposals, which include:

* the replacement of 1,100 structurally-sound social housing units with 2,300 new homes of which only 71 will be social housing;
* the lack of any firm guarantees that any of the 400 mature trees on site will be retained;
* the lack of any renewable energy in the proposed development;
* the high number of parking spaces (616) and increased provision for road traffic proposed, in what is supposed to be a car-free development;
* proposals for the new development to be controlled and managed by a private company.

__Broken Promises__
The group will also argue that the scheme has failed to deliver its promise to Heygate residents that they would be rehoused in the new development.  

__Muggers' Paradise__
The group will be arguing against the council's claim that the estate comprises _'unpopular social housing'_ by quoting a 1999 opinion poll: __"despite years of underinvestment, only 29% of residents were unhappy living on the estate and a majority were in favour of its refurbishment."__(Para. 3.4)

The group has also [submitted crime statistics](http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf) showing that the Heygate estate's crime rate was nearly half the borough average, and will argue that the estate's reputation as 'muggers' paradise' is unfounded and a direct result of council press statements and its use as a film location.

__Viability/Profit__
[Reports submitted by the council](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/8171/proofs_of_evidence__jon_abbot__final_proof) show that it has spent £50m on decanting the estate and is set to spend a further £15m on demolition. In view of the council's disclosure that it will only be receiving an overage payment in return for its land interest, and the developer's admission that the scheme is not financially viable, the objectors will be asking if it is in the public interest for public land to be sold at a loss.

not grandstand just exercising right.

"despite the fact that the redevelopment proposes just 71 social rented homes where 1,000 once stood, and despite the loss of trees etc. the fact that it has run the estate run down over a number of years and emptied it means that the council unfortunately won't have much trouble convincing the inspector that the proposals will lead to an improvement in the area..."  


Abbott - NSP does not constitute the commencement of eviction proceedings. 198 households received NSPs.

Tinker: Shuttleworth knows nothing about the Heygate, he is simply applying a generic model without taking the specifics of the site into account. i.e. noise from NKR. 

McGreal: Why did the council not honour its promise to residents of new homes in the new development? I don't know - I wasn't involved at the time the promises were made.
