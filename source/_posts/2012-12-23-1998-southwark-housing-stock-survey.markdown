In January 1998, Southwark Housing commissioned NBA Consortium Services to provide a comprehensive stock condition survey of its housing stock. 

The Consortium delivered its report in May 1999. You can [download a summary here.](/images/nbasurvey1998.pdf)

The report showed the current condition of housing stock, and estimated costs for maintenance and repairs during the following 30 years.

It found that the average maintenance and repair cost for the entire 40,000 council-owned homes in the borough was estimated at an average of £10,653 per dwelling over 14 years and £23,363 over 30 years.

Top of the list was Gatebeck House in Pytchley rd, East Dulwich, which was estimated to require £147,518 per dwelling in repairs and maintenance over 30 years. This block had subisdence and was demolished in 1999. The site has since remained empty awaiting redevelopment.

Other buildings at the top of the list requiring substantial repairs were those on the Rockingham estate, which came in at around double the average estimate. 

Interestingly, the Heygate estate buildings came in way down the priority list, below average at just £21,742 per dwelling over 30 years, and the Aylesbury estate slightly above average at £23,502.  


Despite the fact that [Council papers](http://betterelephant.github.com/images/strategic24June.pdf) show that repair works have been deferred on the Heygate since as early as 1998, [this recently completed study](http://heygateestate.wordpress.com) by global consulting firm [Gensler](http://www.gensler.com) shows that the Heygate buildings are still in good condition and could still be fully refurbished for just £13,955 per home.

This prompts the question as to why they are being demolished?

Councillor Fiona Colley claims they are being bulldozed because the heating kept breaking down.

The 1,200 council homes on the Heygate used to provide the council with a rental income of around £5m per year. Had it re-invested some of this rental income in repairs then perhaps the heating wouldn't have been breaking down?



[Council papers](http://betterelephant.github.com/images/strategic24June.pdf) cite a different reason for its demolition: _"an ugly and polluted environment and an unrecognised economic potential."_

Well, some reckon that the replacement proposals look pretty ugly, and with the destruction of 400 mature trees the new environment is set to be more polluted than the current one.

Furthermore, [questions are arising](http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/07/has-southwark-done-a-bum-deal-at-the-elephant/) as to whether the council is going to realise any economic benefit from the deal it struck with developer Lend Lease.

[This council press release](http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/305/demolition_begins_on_heygate_estate) says the estate is being demolished because the bad design of its stairwells led to crime and anti-social behaviour. But [these crime statistics](https://sheet.zoho.com/public/adglasspool/heygateestatecrimestats-xls) from the Met Police show that the Heygate's crime rate was 45% below the borough average.

The council's [Compulsory Purchase Order](http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/what-s-the-deal-peter.html) on the other hand, says that the estate is being demolished because it is _"unpopular social housing."_

The council's Project Director Jon Abbott, says the Heygate and shopping centre need to be demolished because they are _"two big large structures preventing the E&C from prospering from its location."_

Ah but, this video is from before the shopping centre owners and [TFL put a spanner in the works](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5430).  The Northern roundabout is staying, so is the traffic and so is the shopping centre - albeit with a couple of [skyscrapers thrown on top.](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6135)  

The way things stand, it looks like Lend Lease and the shopping centre owners will be the only ones prospering from the Elephant's location!
