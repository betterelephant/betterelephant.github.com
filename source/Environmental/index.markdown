"The planned demolition of the Aylesbury & Heygate estates is the social, financial and environmental crime of the decade by a local authority."
{% endblockquote %}  


{%img left http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/uploads/History30.jpg %} __Carbon Emissions:__ The carbon debt incurred by the original demolition and rebuild of the Heygate area 35 years ago, will remain in the atmosphere for a further 65 years. The huge carbon debt proposed for yet another comprehensive demolition and rebuild will remain in the atmosphere for another 100 years. This seriously compromises both the Government’s CO2 reduction targets and [Bill Clinton’s praise for the scheme](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm) as 'carbon positive sustainable growth'.

The current masterplan claims to be undertaking the entire regeneration with a zero increase in carbon emissions. However, what it fails to point out is that its calculations are based purely on 'operative' carbon emission forecasts. What it fails to include are the 'embedded' carbon emissions, i.e. all the carbon emissions resulting not just from the construction of the new buildings, but also those from the original construction of the Heygate estate.

The buildings on the Heygate estate were built to last at least 60 years, and according to the [most recent survey](http://heygate.heroku.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey) they are set to last many decades beyond this. They are constructed with 8"-thick reinforced high-grade concrete panels. Concrete is one of the best insulating materials that can be used in creating energy efficient homes.

{% endblockquote %}

We believe that the full-scale demolition of the Heygate estate is not the most sustainable option, and this is backed by extensive [academic research*](#research). [Recent research](https://docs.google.com/file/d/1Sxege6UHcV9SotFqDdMLlVnjN01gV42lSQm7UrVGOwfLdZtywJE013_YscbT/edit?pli=1) into energy life cycle analysis(ELCA) suggests that embodied energy may be as high as 50% of a building's lifetime energy use. Better Elephant plans to innovatively and sustainably refurbish a number of the Heygate's buildings, based around some of the recommendations made in [this 1998 council-commissioned appraisal study](http://heygate.heroku.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey) and [other recommendations](http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/report_stage2_group1.pdf) put forward by various architectural groups.  

{% img right http://betterelephant.org/images/forest.jpg %} __Trees and Green Space:__ The Heygate estate currently boasts 1.93 hectares of lush green amenity space, containing an [urban forest](http://elephantandcastleurbanforest.com) of around 450 mature trees. The current masterplan will see the destruction of the vast majority of these trees and amenity spaces. We are discussing alternative plans which would involve retaining all of the trees and opening up the amenity spaces with cycle routes and pathways.

We are forming this proposal based on the recommendations made in the [1998 council-commissioned appraisal study](http://heygate.heroku.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey). The survey found that the buildings were in structurally good condition and made recommendations against demolition of the family maisonettes in the middle of the estate. The survey recommended that the surrounding high-rise blocks be demolished while the maisonettes and park areas be retained. _"It is not only the most cost effective option, but also greatly improves the site environmentally, architecturally and socially."_ - (Section 3.2.2)

Similar schemes in other locations - like the [Park Hill estate in Sheffield](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/25/park-hill-sheffield-landmark-revamp) have proven to be a resounding success.
