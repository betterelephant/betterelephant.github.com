"The planned demolition of the Aylesbury & Heygate estates is one of the biggest carbon crimes of the decade by a local authority."
{% endblockquote %}  

We object not just to the financial cost of demolishing the Heygate estate, but also to the environmental cost.

{%img left http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/uploads/History30.jpg %}The carbon debt incurred by the original demolition and rebuild of the Heygate area 35 years ago, will remain in the atmosphere for a further 65 years. The huge carbon debt proposed for yet another comprehensive demolition and rebuild will remain in the atmosphere for another 100 years. This makes the Government’s CO2 reduction targets look hypocritical, and ridicules [Bill Clinton’s praise for the scheme](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8056859.stm) as 'carbon positive sustainable growth'.

The buildings on the Heygate estate were built to last at least 60 years, and according to the most recent survey they are set to last many decades beyond this. They are constructed with 8"-thick reinforced high-grade concrete panels. Concrete is one of the best insulating materials that can be used in creating energy efficient homes. 

Our plan for the local community to purchase the homes on the Heygate estate under the new Localism Act, will see the buildings refurbished and lived in until they have run the full course of their natural life. The existing district-heating system will be converted to carbon-neutral biomass boilers, which will also produce green electricity whose surplus will be exported to the national grid.

The estate will be opened up to the public by creating cycle routes and pathways through the existing 5,000m2 of green space and 450 mature trees on the site.
