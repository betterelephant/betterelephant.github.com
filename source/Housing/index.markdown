> "There are failed estates, but this is not one of them."        [T.Tinker - 2011, Heygate estate original architect.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/mar/04/death-housing-ideal)

Despite having been declared structurally sound{link to Allot&Max survey}, the current regeneration scheme plans to demolish the 1,212 spacious but neglected council homes on the Heygate estate, and replace them with 2,500 new 'city appartments'. Only 12.5% of the new homes planned to be built are designated to be social-rented accommodation.

This is significantly below the requirements set out by Southwark councilâ€™s own planning policy, and the [London Plan](http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan) framework for new developments in the capital. This is a net loss of nearly 1,000 social rented homes at a time when they are most needed. It will serve only to exacerbate the hardship resulting from the current economic crisis, and will result in the existing community being priced out of their neighbourhood. 

In addition only 10% of the new homes built are due to be family homes (3-bedroom). The rest are set to be small 1 or 2 bedroom studio flats, which - if the Strata Tower is anything to go by - will be bought up by investment companies on a buy-to-let basis.

We don't believe that this will create a 'sustainable community', just a transitory population of tenants with little commitment to the area or their neighbours.
The [London Plan](http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan) requires that a minimum of 35% of all new housing built in London is social-rented accommodation. It also requires 40% of these to be 4 bedroom units or larger.

Moreover, the demolition of the Heygate estate would cost the council millions of poundsat a time when it has seen a cut to its budget of 25%. We believe these funds can be better deployed elsewhere. 

The crux of the __Better Elephant__ proposals is to retain the housing on the Heygate estate by purchasing it under the 'Community Right to Buy'. This will be achieved by ... funding ... 

There have already been a number of [imaginative proposals](http://www.nissankejones.com/heygateestate.html) for refurbishing the estate, and altering buildings for alternative use (ie. converting garages to artist studios/workshops etc.)

Our proposals also include a public park in the centre of the estate within the [forest of mature trees](http://elephantandcastleurbanforest.com) and green spaces.

The district-heating system on the estate lends itself nicely to being connected to a biomass boiler, providing eco-friendly warm and energy efficient homes.
