The current plans include 700 car-parking spaces for the new development on the Heygate footprint. We believe these are wholly unnecessary in such a well-connected location and in breach of the council's own planning policy for new developments. This will have an impact on air quality and traffic congestion.

Indeed, one of the key benefits of the original masterplan was that it was going to provide surface crossings at the Northern Roundabout and that the Elephant would be a pedestrian-friendly area. The Mayor has now vetoed this because of impacts on traffic – and if even a small percentage of the thousands of flats here are going to have car parking, that will put many wider benefits of the regeneration at risk. Recent policy has been for this to be a car free development – reflecting the fact that Elephant has two underground routes, is on Thameslink, and has a huge number of bus routes, not to mention that it is within easy walking and cycling distance of the City and the West End.

We request that no more than 10% of the new developments are equipped with parking spaces.

The current masterplan does nothing to address the concerns of cyclists, who will have to cross 8 lanes of traffic in tackling the northern roundabout - which is officially London's most dangerous junction for cyclists.

We request that the current masterplan is revised to include a cycle bypass as proposed [here](http://tiny.cc/elephantbypass).
