Transport

The current plans include 700 car-parking spaces for the new development on the Heygate footprint. We believe these are wholly unnecessary in such a well-connected location and in breach of the council's own planning policy for new developments. This will have an impact on air quality and traffic congestion.

Indeed, one of the key benefits of the original masterplan was that it was going to provide surface crossings at the Northern Roundabout and that the Elephant would be a pedestrian-friendly area. This original plan has been silently dropped from the current masterplan.

The Elephant & Castle has two underground routes, is on Thameslink, and has a huge number of bus routes, not to mention that it is within easy walking and cycling distance of the City and the West End.

The __Better Elephant__ regeneration plan reverts to the original objectives of a car-free development, and addresses the concerns of pedestrians and cyclists, who currently have to negotiate the northern roundabout - officially London's most dangerous junction.
