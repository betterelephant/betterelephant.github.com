Lend Lease, was recently [fined $56m for fraud in the U.S.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/lend-lease-expected-to-admit-to-fraud-scheme.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all) and had a poor financial year in 2011, with their European business declining and an increased reliance on the continuation of the current Australian property bubble. The group is currently rated at one grade above junk status (Baa3), and is carrying enormous debt. According to Reuters news agency it faces 'significant re-financing challenges in 2012/13' (Reuters, 2011). In a climate of global economic uncertainty this raises the very real prospect that Lend Lease will stall construction of the Elephant & Castle developments or even go completely bankrupt. 

The group were forced to seek a Government bailout after it [failed to raise the capital](http://www.thelondonmagazine.co.uk/Property-Experts/The-Olympic-Village.html) required to complete the Olympic Athlete’s Village development in Stratford, and it has recently pulled out of a number of major development commitments in Preston, Stockport, Croydon, Canning Town and [Greenwich Peninsula](http://www.cnbc.com/id/47855382/BRIEF_Lend_Lease_agrees_to_sell_stake_in_Greenwich_Peninsula_Regeneration). [Moody's credit rating agency have warned](http://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Disclosures-on-Credit-Ratings-of-Lend-Lease-Group--PR_247751) "The rating is constrained by an uncertain outlook for the international construction businesses and associated earnings, the size and concentration risk of its development pipeline, particularly the Barangaroo and Elephant & Castle developments."

In December last year, [Southwark Council announced](/images/SNDemolitionCostsDec1st2011.pdf) that it had changed the terms of the Regeneration Agreement and would be [forward funding](/images/SNJuly2012.jpg) the £20m needed to demolish the remainder of the Heygate estate, which it would later recover from Lend Lease once the first phases of development reach completion. This is a clear sign of Lend Lease's worsening financial situation and wavering commitment to the scheme.

A number of other similar developments at the Elephant & Castle have either gone into administration or have been ['land banked'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_banking), and are seeing the area transformed into a barren wasteland:

In order to protect the public life of this area we need imagine alternatives to this type of neoliberal urban regeneration policy, which relies entirely upon debt-financed private capital and makes the future of this low-income part of London dependent on global economic circuits. Our neighbourhood plan proposals are exploring different options for financing the redevelopment of the Heygate estate. We are exploring a number of different options including ['homesteading'](http://emptyhomes.com/what-you-can-do-2/resources/homesteading/), and community land trusts using Government funding for the refurbishment of empty homes. Our proposals are also exploring the possibility of converting some of the existing buildings into office space, workshops and retail.
