Interim gardening on the Heygate estate
-------------------------------

{% img right http://elephantecopark.org/images/heygate.jpg %}The main site of the Heygate estate (North of Heygate st.) spans an area of 17 acres, and is populated with a forest of over 450 mature trees. The current masterplan proposals make NO provision for the interim use of this site during the estimated 15 years that it will take to develop. We believe that this is a waste, and will leave the Elephant surrounded by a barren wasteland for many years to come. We think that we can do better and that it would make a better elephant if the space were used in the interim period.

In many areas, waste and rubbish from the decant had been left littering the site and posing a health risk. Last year, some of the remaining residents whose complaints about the rubbish went unheeded by the council, decided to clean it up themselves. They invited local people to help clear the gardens of the empty properties and started growing vegetables. At the height of the growing season around 40 people were tending vegetable patches on the estate, and activities expanded to include beekeeping, basket-weaving and aquaponics.

They have acquired a number of the council's old recycling containers which are currently being replaced, and are inviting more local residents to come and get involved.

The gardeners meet every Sunday afternoon between 2pm and 5pm, and can be found in the areas marked in red on the map. 

Every Sunday during March is a 'Sowing Sunday', where gardeners will be meeting between 2pm and 5pm in order to sow seeds in the mobile containers. Local residents are invited to come along and start their own mobile garden. Containers and soil will be provided- all that is required are the seeds!
