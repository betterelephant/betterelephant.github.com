'Meanwhile Use' is the temporary use of vacant buildings or land for a socially beneficial purpose until such a time that they can be brought back into commercial use again. It makes practical use of the ‘pauses’ in property processes, giving the space over to uses that can contribute to quality of life and better places whilst the search for a commercial use is ongoing.

Meanwhile use brings clear benefits to local communities through involvement, education and new facilities, and also brings benefits to developers by improving the image of a development and by providing a way of ensuring the engagement of the local community.

The main site of the Heygate estate spans an area of around 20 acres, and is populated with a forest of 400 mature trees. The current masterplan proposals make no provision for the interim use of this site during the estimated 15 years that it will take to develop. Better Elephant has been working with local people, former and remaining residents to keep this space alive. We have been facilitating activities including freerunning, gardening, [go-carting](http://releasethewolves.org/) and [cinema screenings](/blog/2012/09/25/heygate-cinemas-opening-night/). 

Last year, the Heygate gardeners decided to clean up more of the disused green spaces and invite more local people to start growing vegetables. Activities have now expanded to include beekeeping, basket-weaving and a fish pond for an aquaponics system.

This year, the gardeners have been extending use of the space to other concreted areas within the site. They have [acquired a number of the council's old recycling containers](http://www.veoliaenvironmentalservices.co.uk/Southwark/About-us/News/Press-releases/Grow-your-own-in-the-old-blue-box/) which are currently being replaced, and are inviting more local residents to come and get involved. We also organise events including walks, talks and screenings - you can find out more about these from the [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/185092524956032/) page or follow our twitter feed @betterelephant for upcoming events.

There are a wide range of tools and materials on site - local residents are invited to come and get involved. The gardeners meet every Sunday afternoon between 2pm and 5pm, and can be found either in the allotment areas marked in red on the map, or in the meeting area underneath the Great Maple tree on the Cuddington block of maisonettes:   {% img http://alicecalcagno.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_9857-2.jpg?w=750&h=502 %}
