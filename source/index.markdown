__Better Elephant__ is a community-led group exploring proposals for an alternative and more sustainable regeneration of the Elephant & Castle.

We believe that the current development model being proposed by developers [Lend Lease](http://www.lendlease.com/Group/Lend-Lease/EMEA/United%20Kingdom/Home.aspx) is not environmentally sustainable and has become outdated. It was conceived more than 15 years ago and fails to address the new global challenges of climate change, economic hardship and shrinking supplies of cheap energy. We are creating a more [environmentally](/Environmental), [socially](/Social) and [economically](Economic) sustainable development plan, as a co-ordinated local response to the current environmental and economic crisis. Our plans explore alternatives to displacing long-standing communities and replacing structurally sound affordable public housing with private gated developments.

The new Localism Act that was passed on November 15 2011, introduced new rights and powers to allow local communities to shape local planning developments by preparing [neighbourhood plans](http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/inyourarea/neighbourhood/).

[Better Elephant](http://betterelephant.org) is currently helping to draft a neighbourhood plan for the Elephant & Castle area, which explores alternative options to full-scale demolition of the Heygate estate. Our proposals include a [community-led refurbishment](http://emptyhomes.com/what-you-can-do-2/resources/homesteading/) of the existing buildings, renewable energy generation and local food growing initiatives.  

We are planning to publish the draft version of our neighbourhood plan in January 2013 for consultation and feedback from the wider community.
