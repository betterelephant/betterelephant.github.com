Financial cost of Heygate demolition
------------------------------------

{% blockquote Dickon Robinson, Development Director at the Peabody Trust %}
"It is ridiculously expensive to knock housing estates down. These are not dysfunctional buildings- if you invest in them they will be perfectly fine."
{% endblockquote %}

It is commonly misunderstood that the sale of the Heygate's 10 hectares of public-owned land, will end up raising funds for the council's cash-strapped coffers. The reality is that the land is being transferred into private ownership not just at a social but also at a financial cost to the public. What is often overlooked in these schemes is the astronomical cost of emptying an entire neighbourhood and rehousing 3,000 people.

[{% img right http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7205/6941270523_0f960871ca_m.jpg %}](http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/allot_max_survey_summary_1998.pdf)In 1998, the council commissioned an appraisal study investigating seven different options for repair/refurbishment/rebuilding of the estate including the option of full demolition. The [appraisal study concluded](http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/allot_max_survey_summary_1998.pdf) that of all seven options, full demolition was the most expensive- coming in at an estimated £53 million. The estimate refers to a footnote further on in the report, which states that this option would also incur the additional cost of buying back the leaseholders on the estate (*4.22.1 - "Decant costs have not been included for leaseholders"*). A [Freedom of Information request](https://docs.google.com/open?id=1YUbsi2Uvx0ASInuFw9nHr8ep2K78xfdIfIKGKlb_rNst8uYxGCSnMGItEIVX) has confirmed that this has now exceeded £20 million.   

Costs that were not included in the report's estimate include the loss of rent, which has now amounted to over £25 million, and is accruing at a rate of approx. £100,000 per week. Plus the estate is currently costing the council [£22,000 per year for estate lighting](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23878085-council-paying-pound-22000-to-light-derelict-estate.do) and [£48,500 per month for private security](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,21858,185,00.htm).

This represents a current net loss to the taxpayer of well over £100 million, and the costs are still accruing. Full refurbishment of the estate would have cost less than half of this amount, and would have left this vast area of land in public ownership. [A 1999 MORI poll](http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/heygate_mori_poll1999.pdf) confirmed that residents were opposed to demolition and displacement, and that 63% of residents were in favour of remaining on the Heygate estate.

In terms of what Southwark council is receiving in return for the sale of the Heygate estate to Lend Lease- we still don't know if there will be any capital receipt at all. The current labour administration is determined to keep the details of the deal it signed with the Australian developer under wraps. In March this year, it even went as far taking [legal action against a fellow Lib-Dem Councillor](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5869) for having disclosed some particulars of the agreement.
