The future of the Elephant & Castle has become dependent on Lend Lease Ltd, a global property development company headquartered in Australia. In order to protect the public life of this area we need imagine alternatives to this type of neoliberal urban regeneration policy, which relies on debt-financed private capital. This model of development makes the future of this low-income part of London dependent on global economic circuits. A global context is vital to understanding the enormous risks attached to this public reliance on private finance. Lend Lease had a poor financial year in 2011, with their European business declining and an increased reliance on the continuation of the current Australian property bubble. The group is carrying enormous debt, and according to Reuters news agency it faces 'significant re-financing challenges in 2012/13' (Reuters, 2011). In a climate of global economic uncertainty this raises the very real prospect that Lend Lease will stall construction of the Elephant & Castle developments or even go completely bankrupt. All this emphasises the uncertainty for this part of Southwark and its local community.
