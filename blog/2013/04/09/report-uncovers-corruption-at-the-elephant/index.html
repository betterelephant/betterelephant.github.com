<p>The report reveals a number of former council officers involved in negotiations with developer Lend Lease for the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/02/southwark-council-accidentally-leaks-confidential-information-about-controversial-heygate-re">controversial sale</a> of the Heygate estate, who have left the council and are now full-time employees of Lend Lease corporation.<br/>

Beyond the Council&#8217;s senior planning &amp; regeneration team officers who have defected to the private development sector, a more than significant number of Council members have also slinked through Southwark&#8217;s revolving doors:</p>
