<div class="entry-content"><h2>Comments on the Final Masterplan - Poverty of Process</h2>

<p>The deadline for comments on the final masterplan passed yesterday. The <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com">Elephant Amenity Network (EAN)</a> is a coalition of local groups and people that includes council tenants, leaseholders, shopkeepers, market traders and community groups. Since July 2011, members of the EAN have been actively engaging with the consultation process, which was set up by developers &#8216;Lend Lease&#8217; who employed a PR company called &#8216;Soundings&#8217; to manage it. Now that the consultation has ended, members of the EAN group have expressed their frustration at the shortcomings of the process. Here are some of their comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I decided there was little point in providing another detailed submission. 90% of the comments I made in July 2011 (exhibition 1) and October 2011 (exhibition 2) have not been responded to at all, let alone realised in terms of any significant changes to the masterplan. My 1st contact with Soundings was to ask whether they thought the principles of neighbourhood planning and the Localism Act were relevant to their work at the Elephant and Castle. I never received an answer.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Richard Lee</strong><cite>EAN Member & Local Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>EAN&#8217;s criticisms of the masterplan included the following</p>

<ul>
<li>Insufficient affordable and social housing</li>
<li>The ‘affordable’ housing which is due to be provided is anything but affordable <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SouthwarkTargetRents.pdf">(1-bed social-rented units starting at £275 per week!)</a></li>
<li>Too few family-size homes</li>
<li>Over-provision of parking spaces, completely unnecessary in a public transport hub</li>
<li>No Local and sustainable food production (allotments and permaculture)</li>
<li>No Recognition of natural habitats</li>
<li>No 20 mph speed limit zones</li>
<li>No reference to schools, GP’s, community managed and owned amenities</li>
<li>No teenage play and youth provision</li>
<li>No Local jobs target (How can we ensure that any of the jobs created will go to local people?)</li>
<li>No London Living Wage guarantee (How are we to ensure that any of the jobs created will pay a reasonable wage?)</li>
<li>No Working with voluntary and community sector employment/training providers (How can we ensure that local people can receive the training to take up the the new jobs?)</li>
<li>No Procurement policies that support local providers (How are we to ensure that contracts go to local businesses?)</li>
<li>No Support for existing local independent retail (How are we to ensure that existing local retailers are not priced out of the area by high st. chain stores?)</li>
<li>No guarantee of a fully accessible public realm (How can we ensure that the new public park will be truly public and accessible to all if privately owned?)</li>
<li>No provision of existing buildings for interim use (empty existing buildings could be put to use during the 15 years that the development is estimated to take)</li>
<li>No provision to maintain public access through all sites (The Heygate estate&#8217;s 25 acres of land is set to be enclosed by a fence for the next 15 years)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Noise-</strong> The new layout is connected and permeable, but it will open the centre of the site to noise and pollution from the Elephant&#8217;s major roads. At present, the Heygate&#8217;s perimeter blocks act as a very effective barrier to the noise and pollution from the Walworth &amp; New Kent roads. The new layout does nothing to address these issues.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7066/6815836156_2d4417b1fa_z.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7066/6815836156_2d4417b1fa_m.jpg"></a><strong>The park</strong> The park is very narrow in relation to its length. It would appear that the park has been positioned according to the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4142">serpentine viewing corridor</a>, along a narrow east-to-west strip which is entirely encapsulated by high-rise blocks. The obvious disadvantage is that the park will be permanently overshadowed by the new buildings on its Southern border, and is likely to end up becoming London&#8217;s first ever park to be built entirely in the shade. The exhibition models in the final masterplan exhibition were misleading: the surrounding buildings were shown in Perspex on the exhibition model, which neatly avoided any true sense of enclosure; light perspectives on most of the visual imagery provided at the exhibition were incorrectly represented, with the sun shining from the North-West on one of the computer-generated images of the new park.</p>

<p>Despite numerous concerns about the publicness of the new public park, this area has also been left in the dark. The local community have been pressing to formalise the arrangements here, in order to avoid the ‘privatised public space’ model – places like More London or New Street Square, where security guards pounce on subversive activities like picnics or photography. The park should be adopted by Southwark to protect it legally in perpetuity as public open space and to ensure that public interests are upheld.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/6963713367_960d357bdb_b.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/6963713367_960d357bdb_m.jpg"></a><strong>Sustainability-</strong><br/>
The question of sustainability in the masterplan approach, is of course predicated on the premise that the site must be completely redeveloped [and not innovatively and – possibly - more sustainably refurbished as a prototype for the future]. None of the questionnaires have ever allowed for this response, answers to the limited questions about priorities must not be interpreted to assume that all respondents agree to wholesale redevelopment.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I attended the sustainability workshop on 15th December. During the workshop, I suggested the provision of independent evidence on the potential CO2 implications of the redevelopment project, which includes the analysis of embodied carbon in the current buildings on the Heygate estate, plus the estimated carbon footprint of the new development. Lend Lease&#8217;s representative agreed to provide these once the masterplan had been finalised. When the [minutes of the sustainability workshop](http://www.elephantandcastle.org.uk/download,89,sustainability_workshop_minutes.pdf) were circulated by Soundings - two months later on 13th February - the minutes failed to include my suggestion concerning the carbon analysis. I contacted Soundings to request that the meetings minutes were updated to include my proposal, and despite numerous follow-up emails I have still had no response.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>A Glasspool</strong><cite>EAN Member & Heygate Estate Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The <a href="http://www.elephantandcastle.org.uk/download,93,sustainability.pdf">exhibition board for sustainability</a> at the final masterplan exhibition stated the following objectives: ‘Social aim – to deliver a genuinely mixed-use neighbourhood, as an integral part of a wider regenerated area, for all ages, backgrounds and means.’</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is patent nonsense – people of all ages, backgrounds and means cannot afford to stay at the Elephant, given the very low proportion of social rented and really affordable housing.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Annie Lennox</strong><cite>EAN Member & Local Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is an insult to myself and the rest of the 3,000-strong community on the Heygate, who have been strong-armed and intimidated out of their homes, and will now remain permanently priced out of the area.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>A Glasspool</strong><cite>EAN Member & Heygate Estate Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7195/6963708953_48767ec1df_b.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7195/6963708953_48767ec1df_m.jpg"></a><strong>Trees-</strong>
The exhibition board for Landscape &amp; Trees shows removed trees only as small red dots, which is a graphic technique aimed at playing down the impact of tree felling. Moreover, the display is wholly inaccurate: a large number of existing trees are not depicted on the map whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>General-</strong>On a general level, the final masterplan exhibition refers to material that will be submitted, in a few weeks, as part of the outline planning application. This includes the amount of floorspace per use, the environmental impact assessment, access and landscaping statements and some 16 other supporting documents.</p>

<p>Yet the exhibition largely restricted itself to colourful bite-size displays and non-specific statements. A huge amount of new material will suddenly emerge with the planning application, which could and should have been covered in the public exhibition.</p>

<p>Local residents have had no opportunity to input into these documents, there have been no panels, no cooperative survey work, no sharing of frameworks, let alone a collaborative approach to the production of documents.</p>
