  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/dec/27/1"><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/novote.png" width="350" height="200"></a>There are a few subtle differences between the Heygate and the Aylesbury regeneration schemes. The first is that Heygate residents were <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/councilrulesoutvote.pdf">denied a ballot</a> on the future of their estate, whereas Aylesbury residents were fully balloted. Page 2 of <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050927/Agenda/Item%2007%20-%20The%20AylesburyEstate%20Revised%20Strategy%20-%20Report.pdf">This 2005 Council Executive Committee report</a> shows the results of the ballot:</p>

<p><img src="http://betterelephant.org/images/ballot.png"></p>

<p>Further down in the report, the Council tries to speculate as to the reasons behind the residents&#8217; comprehensive rejection of its redevelopment plans:</p>

<p><img src="http://betterelephant.org/images/aylesburyballot.png"></p>

<p>Note the Council&#8217;s observation that <strong> <em>&#8220;some residents didn&#8217;t believe the new Housing Association would be able to keep its commitments on rents and service charges&#8221;</em> </strong>.</p>

<p>We are now starting to see that residents&#8217; early concerns about rent increases were very well founded. In the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/279910_1.pdf">legal agreement</a> for the <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/lq-wins-work-on-next-phase-of-aylesbury-plan/6522708.article">most recent phase</a> of the Aylesbury scheme to be granted planning approval, the definition of social rented housing refers to the London Plan and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector--2/supporting-pages/providing-affordable-homes-for-rent">HCA definition</a> of affordable rented housing of up to 80% market rents:</p>

<p><img src="http://35percent.org/images/wolvertons106SR.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/41_LBSouthwark_Session3.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://35percent.org/images/SouthwarkMarketRents.png" width="350" height="350"></a>So whilst tenants will have the right to return to a new housing association property in the scheme, the new &#8216;social&#8217; housing rents will be significantly higher than the existing Council rents.</p>

<p>This table from the Council&#8217;s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/41_LBSouthwark_Session3.pdf">June 2014 Affordable Rent Product Study</a> shows Southwark&#8217;s market rent figures for a 1-bed flat at £289 per week for the Aylesbury postcode (SE17). 80% of this will well over double the existing Council rents on the estate and affordable to very few existing Council tenants.</p>

<h2>Refurbishment vs Demolition</h2>

<p><a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s43556/Report%20Selection%20of%20a%20Preferred%20Partner%20to%20Work%20with%20the%20Council%20to%20Deliver%20the%20Regeneration%20of%20the.pdf">Council briefing papers</a> show that the Council is estimated to be spending a staggering £150m emptying and demolishing the Aylesbury estate.</p>

<p><a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s43556/Report%20Selection%20of%20a%20Preferred%20Partner%20to%20Work%20with%20the%20Council%20to%20Deliver%20the%20Regeneration%20of%20the.pdf"><img src="http://betterelephant.org/images/150m.png"></a></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/SixAcresRegeneration.png" width="300" height="300">As we pointed out in our <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2014/07/11/london-assembly-investigation-into-housing-estate-refurbishment-and-demolition/">previous blog post</a>, other London boroughs are making better use of their scarce resources. Islington has an estate called the Six Acres estate near Finsbury Park. The Six Acres estate was built at the same time as Heygate &amp; Aylesury, by the same contractors (Laing) using the same system (Jespersen 12M).</p>

<p>Instead of demolshing its estate and handing it over to the private sector at a loss, Islington Council chose to refurbish the Six Acres estate in 2012. The 473 homes on the estate were refurbished with <a href="http://www.lawtechltd.co.uk/Project_Tollington.aspx">new external wall insulation</a>, new entry doors, exterior furnishing improvements, <a href="http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study.pdf">green roofs</a> and <a href="http://greenroofshelters.co.uk/green-roofed-cycle-shelters-for-islington/">cycle shelters</a>.</p>

<p>The entire Six Acres estate refurbishment and public realm improvement works cost a total of just £5.15m. This works out at around £10k per dwelling; far less than the circa £60k per dwelling that Southwark Council is spending on emptying and demolshing the Aylesbury estate (£150m/2500 homes).</p>

<p>Extensive <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/demolition-refurbishment-social-housing/">research by the University College London</a> and <a href="https://heygateestate.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/genslerheygate.pdf">case studies</a> by leading architects has shown that refurbishment is better not just financially, but also socially and environmentally.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/yacht-cannes-selling-homes-local-government-officials-mipim">international property fair <strong>MIPIM</strong></a> wasn&#8217;t just for developers and councils, it was also for those who help developers lobby councils. <a href="http://www.fourcommunications.com/"><strong>Four Communications</strong></a> is one such company. It says it offers teams of experts who <em>&#8220;provide support at every stage of the planning, marketing and communications process&#8221;</em> and helps to secure <a href="https://www.fourcommunications.com/work-gallery/helping-secure-new-community-stadium"><em>&#8220;political support in the face of public opposition&#8221;</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://my.mipim.com/online-database/mipim/companies/#search=d%3D101990%7C0F%26startRecord%3D205%26rpp%3D12"><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/FourMipimStand.png"></a></p>

<p>Who are these &#8216;experts&#8217; able to magically gain the &#8216;political support&#8217; of council members in developments facing public opposition?  Well, who better than council members themselves?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.fourcommunications.com/sites/default/files/styles/four_square/public/people/jeremy.png?itok=IDqYOvmA"><strong>Four Communications</strong> was <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm">founded</a> in 2001 by former (Labour) Southwark council leader Jeremy Fraser. On its payroll and <a href="/images/OneStopReport.pdf">list of shareholders</a> are former (Labour) Lambeth council leader <a href="http://www.fourcommunications.com/who-we-are/our-people/jim-dickson">Jim Dickson</a> (who is also a <a href="http://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=165">sitting Lambeth councillor</a>) and Southwark&#8217;s former (Labour) Cabinet Member for Regeneration Steve Lancashire<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The South Bank&#8217;s King&#8217;s Reach Tower provides a good example of how <strong>Four Communications</strong>&#8217; lobbying service works. In 2010, Developer <a href="http://www.cit.co.uk/"><strong>CIT</strong></a> employed <strong>Four</strong> to &#8216;help&#8217; get permission for its controversial 41 storey Blackfriars development. This is how <strong>Four</strong>&#8217;s 4 step lobbying process was implemented:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Four</strong>&#8217;s Steve Lancashire sets up meetings with his Southwark Labour cronies Peter John (council leader) and Fiona Colley (Cabinet Member for Regeneration).
<a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/152101_1.pdf"><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/FourCommunicationsMeetingsCouncilMembers.png' width='' height='' title='Extract from page 6 of King's Reach SCI produced by Four Communications'><span class='caption-text'>Extract from page 6 of King&#8217;s Reach SCI produced by Four Communications</span></span></a></li>
<li>The old friends agree to nod through the development despite its numerous planning policy breaches like the lack of any on-site affordable housing.</li>
<li>The council leader and regen boss brief their planning officers instructing them to recommend the application to the (heavily whipped) planning committee.</li>
<li><strong>Four</strong> conducts a bogus consultation and produces a <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/152101_1.pdf">&#8216;Statement of Community Involvement&#8217;</a>, providing phony evidence that local residents support the application.</li>
</ol>


<p>Every major planning application requires a Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) to demonstrate that the developer has consulted with the local community and that its plans have public support. <strong>Four</strong> has helped developers obtain permission and produced SCIs for an impressive list of (social housing-free) developments in Southwark. The table below provides links to the SCIs created by <strong>Four</strong> for each of the following developments which it helped obtain permission:</p>

<p><a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/15810_1.pdf"><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/StrataSCI.png' width='370' height='350' title='See page 19 of Strata Tower SCI'><span class='caption-text'>See page 19 of Strata Tower SCI</span></span></a>Another working example is Strata Tower, which shows what a sham <strong>Four</strong>&#8217;s SCI consultation process is: its consultation showed that it had consulted just 13 people - hardly evidence of widespread public support. Unsurprisingly most of these agreed to the vague and narrowly-framed questions aimed at restricting any kind of meaningful consultation:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;The design of the scheme should be of the highest quality&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Any new proposals should be environmentally friendly&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;It is important that local residents continue to be consulted as plans move forward&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>


<p>The planning application was duly nodded through and Strata Tower - entirely without social rented housing but complete with useless wind turbines - was built.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/dimoldenberg.jpg' width='300' height='300' title='Private Eye (issue 1380 - 25 Nov 2014)'><span class='caption-text'>Private Eye (issue 1380 - 25 Nov 2014)</span></span>It is worth noting that the council&#8217;s E&amp;C regeneration partner Lend Lease, is absent from the list of <strong>Four</strong>&#8217;s clients. That&#8217;s because Lend Lease employs a different PR company called <a href="http://www.quatro-pr.co.uk/"><strong>Quatro</strong></a> to handle PR for its developments. It&#8217;s also worth noting that <strong>Quatro</strong>&#8217;s Managing Director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/paul-dimoldenberg/a/5b5/b44">Paul Dimoldenberg</a>, is a former senior Southwark council officer and current leader of the Labour group on Westminster city council.</p>

<p></br>
</br>
</br>
As covered in a <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/04/09/report-uncovers-corruption-at-the-elephant/">previous post</a>, Southwark&#8217;s former Lib Dem and Conservative leaders have shown no greater integrity and are both now helping developers obtain planning permission for developments in Southwark. But what makes the Labour leaders&#8217; double-dealing particularly dangerous is their political strangleholds in Southwark and Lambeth: the lack of any opposition party provides the leaders with a free hand to wave all these developments through unscrutinised.</p>

<p>Southwark and Lambeth&#8217;s corrupt Labour clique has given a whole new meaning to the New Labour mantra of <strong>&#8220;inclusive prosperity&#8221;</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsMSNi1IEAEATUy.jpg:large" width="300" height="200">Last Friday saw the second meeting of the London Assembly&#8217;s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-assembly/london-assembly/investigations/demolition-and-refurbishment-of-social-housing-estates-in-london">investigation</a> into the refurbishment and demoliton of council estates. The first meeting in June had heard from regeneration industry &#8216;specialists&#8217;, who caused a stir when Stephen McDonald, Southwark&#8217;s former head of regeneration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-olUu1wHqA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h6m16s">boasted</a> about winning an award for &#8216;emptying&#8217; the Heygate of its residents in under a year. Stephen is now working for Barnet Council emptying the West Hendon estate of its residents.</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s meeting gave the opportunity for an alternative perspective and for those directly affected by regeneration schemes to have their say. Among the highlights from speakers at the meeting were:</p>

<p>Roy Kindle - formerly of Greenwich Council who said: <a href="http://youtu.be/laCg-kfcpIE?t=1h6m33s"><em>&#8220;10 years ago residents on the Ferrier estate were told that they would have the right to come back, but what Greenwich didn&#8217;t mention is that they would need to win the lottery to do so.&#8221;</em></a></p>

<p>Richard Lee from the <a href="http://justspace.org.uk/">Just Space Network</a> who explained that <a href="http://youtu.be/laCg-kfcpIE?t=1h21m44s"><em>&#8220;decisions to demolish seem to be based on some kind of ideological, policy-driven agenda rather than a robust cost/benefit analysis - technical reports very rarely look at the question of embodied carbon.&#8221;</em></a></p>

<p>Chris Jofeh, Director of <a href="http://arup.com">Arup</a> (the consulting engineers who were involved in the original Heygate construction and also the redevelopment) claimed that <a href="http://youtu.be/laCg-kfcpIE?t=1h50m15s"><em>&#8220;Demolition and rebuild emits a super amount of carbon dioxide and even if you build super-efficient new homes it could take 30 years before you redress the balance. If we do take carbon targets seriously then refurbishment is an option which is much more likely to achieve those targets.&#8221;</em></a></p>

<p>Twice during the meeting the question was asked &#8220;can anybody give a positive example of regeneration?&#8221;; unfortunately the answer was silence accompanied by widespread shoulder shrugging.</p>

<p>This is a problem, particularly when the issue is polarised around the two opposed camps of refurbishment versus demolition. In the context of the seemingly universal agreement around housing shortages and the need for density increases, this can lead to equally universal <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2013/feb/13/elephant-and-castle-southwark-council-regeneration-rights-and-wrongs">claims</a> that there is no alternative to the Heygate &amp; Aylesbury-style wholesale discounted disposal option.</p>

<p>What these polarised perspectives miss are the plethora of possibilities inbetween the two poles of refurbishment versus demolition. For example, in 1998 Southwark Council commissioned consulting engineers &#8216;Allot &amp; Lomax&#8217; (now part of the <a href="http://www.jacobs.com/">Jacobs</a> group) to conduct a survey and <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">options appraisal study</a> for the Heygate estate. The engineers declared all of the buildings structurally sound but recommended that 6 of the estate&#8217;s 19 blocks be demolished and redeveloped to fit in with the Council&#8217;s plan to increase density, permeability and tenure mix; the remaining 13 blocks they recommended for refurbishment.</p>

<p>However, Southwark rejected the consultants&#8217; recommendations on the grounds that <em>&#8220;it was recognised at the time that changing land values could make the complete demolition and redevelopment by the private sector a better option.&#8221;</em><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></p>

<p>We are now 15 years on from this decision and are just beginning to be able to evaluate its social, economic and environmental outcomes:</p>

<p><strong>Economic:</strong> Southwark Council has spent far more on &#8216;decanting&#8217; the estate than expected. By Jan 2013 it had incurred capital and revenue costs totalling £65m<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.<br/>
<strong>Social:</strong> the social impact of the scheme and its failure to provide the new homes promised to Heygate residents has been widely <a href="http://heygate.github.io">documented</a>.<br/>
<strong>Environmental:</strong> the continued emphasis on the operative carbon emission comparisons between Heygate buildings and its intended replacements entirely disavows the question of embodied carbon, i.e. the carbon emitted from the construction of materials contained both in existing buildings and their replacements. <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">This</a> 2012 report by <a href="http://gensler.com">Gensler</a> &amp; <a href="http://baqus.co.uk">Baqus</a> shows that 40,000 tonnes of C02 emissions could have been saved by the estate&#8217;s refurbishment.</p>

<p>So what might the Heygate have looked like had the Council followed the advice of its consultants?</p>

<p><a href="/images/SixAcresRegeneration.png"><img class="right" src="/images/SixAcresRegeneration.png" width="300" height="300"></a>Islington&#8217;s Six Acres estate in Finsbury park was built in 1969 - five years before the Heygate and Aylesbury.<br/>
In 2011 Islington Council passed plans for the regeneration of the estate. In 2012 the plans were implemented commencing with the demolition of one of the maisonette blocks containing 72 social rented homes. That part of the site along with the former car park, was sold for £8.4m to <a href="http://onehousinggroup.co.uk">&#8216;One Housing Group&#8217;</a> who built 164 new homes comprising a <a href="http://planning.islington.gov.uk/NorthgatePublicDocs/00195878.pdf">mix</a> of 82 private, 65 social rented and 17 intermediate units. All new homes were equipped with solar hot water and ground-source heat pumps. The remaining 9 blocks on the estate comprising 473 council homes were refurbished with <a href="http://www.lawtechltd.co.uk/Project_Tollington.aspx">new external wall insulation</a>, new entry doors, exterior furnishing improvements, <a href="http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study.pdf">green roofs</a> and <a href="http://greenroofshelters.co.uk/green-roofed-cycle-shelters-for-islington/">cycle shelters</a>.</p>

<p>Disregarding the demolition and construction cost of the new homes, the refurbishment and landscaping works amounted to a total cost of just £5.15m. This works out at around £10k per dwelling, far less than the circa £50k per dwelling that Southwark Council has spent on emptying the Heygate estate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There has been a lot of crowing by Council Regeneration Boss Fiona Colley recently, about how many jobs the regeneration will bring.<br/>
In her <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/sep/23/elephant-castle-regeneration-heygate-estate#start-of-comments">letter</a> published in last week&#8217;s Guardian, she claims that the regeneration will deliver <strong> <em>&#8220;5,000 jobs, giving local people genuine opportunities to develop skills and earn a decent income.&#8221;</em> </strong></p>

<p>She was subsequently busy on Twitter asking if anybody was interested in <strong> <em>&#8216;getting paid to demolish the Heygate&#8217;</em> </strong>:
<img class="center" src="/images/TwitterConversation.jpg"></p>

<p>One user replied to Cllr Colley with the question &#8216;will these jobs be for locals?&#8217; Better Elephant pointed out the fact that <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=20296">Southwark is paying £15m</a> to Lend Lease to demolish the estate, and asked whether the jobs would be paying the London Living Wage?</p>

<p>Cllr Colley failed to respond to either question.</p>

<p>The questions are pertinent in view of the large sums of public money flowing into what is essentially a private development. Southwark has already spent a total of £65m in just emptying the estate and progressing its redevelopment<a href="See">^1</a>; it is about to spend a further £15m paying Lend Lease to demolish it, and the question of whether any of this will flow into the hands of local people after Lend Lease and Keltbray have taken their cut is a valid one.</p>

<p>In finding an answer we could look at a case study example of how regeneration contracts have benefited local people so far:</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_costs">this FOI request</a>, Southwark council has spent £1.28m on private security for the Heygate estate over the past 4 years. We don&#8217;t have an exact breakdown of the costs, but <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/elephant_and_castle_council_esta">we do know</a> that in April 2008 a contract was awarded to a company called <em>&#8216;Safe Estates Services Ltd&#8217;</em> to provide regular night-time security for the estate in exchange for the sum of £13,500 per month. Companies House <a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?link=51">records</a> show that <em>Safe Estates Services</em> appears to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_purpose_entity">special purpose vehicle</a> set up specifically for the Heygate contract: <a href="/images/SafeEstatesLtd.pdf">company accounts</a> show that it has no employees, pays no tax, and is a subsidiary of VPS Holdings Ltd, which is in turn a subsidiary of TDR Capital LLP.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/LapaSecurity.jpg">Further investigation reveals that <em>Safe Estates</em> has simply subcontracted the entire contract to another firm <a href="http://www.lapasecurity.co.uk/"><em>&#8216;Lapa Security Ltd&#8217;</em></a>, which is based in Swanley, Kent and which <a href="http://www.laparecruitment.co.uk/services/security-recruitment">according to its website</a> offers <strong> <em>&#8220;comprehensive security recruitment services in Orpington, Bromley, Swanley and Dartford.&#8221;</em> </strong>. <em>Lapa</em> then entrusts the Heygate contract to its self-employed security guards on zero-hour contracts. The self-employed security guards comprise one dog handler with his own vehicle and dog paid £9 per hour, and one security guard without a dog who is paid £6.30 per hour.</p>

<p>If we multiply the hourly rates by the 7x11 hour night shifts, we find that from the £13,500 per month paid by the council, less than a third is ending up in the hands of the actual contractors on the ground. The lion&#8217;s share of the contract sum is skimmed off by a number of middle men in the form of tax-avoiding holding companies and sub sub-contractors - each taking their cut.</p>

<p>The £6.30 per hour wage is also well below the London Living Wage of £8.55 per hour, to which Southwark as one of only 9 boroughs in London <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1035/southwark_leads_the_way_on_fair_pay">committed to sign up last year</a>. It even specifically committed to extend this also to contractors and agency staff.</p>

<p>Whatsmore, on September 30th Lend Lease took possession of half of the Heygate site. Lend Lease has subcontracted the demolition of the next phase of the estate to a company called <a href="http://www.keltbray.com/"><em>Keltbray</em></a>, who have subcontracted the security of their compound to a company called <a href="http://www.clipfine.com/security.php"><em>Clipfine</em></a>. It has also emerged that <em>Clipfine</em> is failing to pay its security guards the London Living Wage, despite the fact that the Heygate planning application&#8217;s legal agreement binds Lend Lease into ensuring all its contractors and subcontractors are paid the London Living Wage<a href="See">^2</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/livingwage.jpg"></p>

<p>Of course this legal agreement is worthless without a council willing to enforce it, and without a council-backed investigation it is very unlikely that any subcontractors will come forward, as they run the risk of being permanently condemned to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21155535">construction industry blacklist</a>.</p>

<p>So it looks like the Elephant regeneration is going the same way as Lend Lease&#8217;s Olympic Village development where despite all promises workers were also routinely <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/olympic-recruits-paid-less-than-london-living-wage-6525529.html">found being paid less</a> than the London Living Wage.</p>

<p>Furthermore, during the whole six-year duration of the contract, not one security guard employed by <em>Lapa</em> under the council&#8217;s contract has been a Southwark resident. So is this what Cllr Colley means by <strong> <em>&#8220;giving local people genuine opportunities to develop skills and earn a decent income&#8221;?</em> </strong>Or is it just yet another example of her administration&#8217;s propensity to make countless meaningless promises and statements?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.justice.gov.uk/__data/assets/image/0017/2960/hmcts-logo.gif">In a bizarre attempt to avoid having to disclose how much profit it will make from the Heygate redevelopment, developer Lend Lease has appealed to the Information Tribunal claiming human rights infringements.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://evacpack.co.uk/ICO.jpg" width="200" height="150"><a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/Lend_Lease_Response_to_LBS_Grounds_of_Appeal.pdf">Its appeal</a> has been made against the Information Commissioner&#8217;s <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner/">recent ruling</a> that full financial details of its agreement with Southwark Council to redevelop the estate must be disclosed.<br/>
</br>
</br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://cf.mp-cdn.net/57/20/9677b17716a92e9257740f1b22b0-do-we-need-the-human-rights-act.jpg">
</br>
In appealing Lend Lease has cited <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/II/chapter/1">Article 1 of the Human Rights Act</a>, which states that <strong> <em>&#8220;Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest.&#8221;</em> </strong></p>

<p>Lend Lease claims that <strong> <em>&#8220;the disputed information in this case constitutes Lend Lease&#8217;s &#8216;possessions&#8217;&#8221;</em> </strong> and that <strong> <em>&#8220;disclosure would interfere with Lend Lease&#8217;s entitlement to its possessions.&#8221;</em> </strong><a href="See">^1</a></p>

<p>This desperate attempt to clutch at legal straws would be comical were it not for the fact that Lend Lease had recently spent £3m <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/07/18/regeneration-branded-miserable-failure-at-cpo-public-inquiry/">convincing the Government inspectorate</a> that it is entitled to deprive the last remaining Heygate residents of the peaceful enjoyment of their homes.</p>

<p>How in any case is the world&#8217;s largest property company - worth an estimated £3bn - able to stake a claim to any human rights one might ask?</p>

<p>Many countries prohibit a legal entity from holding human rights, unfortunately Britain is not one of them. This <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/28/hedge-fund-human-rights">Guardian article</a> shows that it is a growing trend in the UK, partly as an act of desperation by companies when all else fails.</p>

<p>So if Lend Lease were a person then what kind of person would it be?   Answers on a postcard please&#8230;</p>

<p>And why is it so determined to keep the Heygate financial figures secret?<br/>
Maybe because it will show how much profit it expects to make from the redevelopment, which won&#8217;t look good against what Southwark is making - or indeed losing from it. The appeal documents also show that the council has now spent a total of £65m in just emptying the estate and progressing its redevelopment<a href="See">^2</a> whilst leaked documents show that it <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/02/04/council-accidentally-publishes-confidential-regeneration-agreement/">stands to receive just £50m</a> from Lend Lease in return for the site.</p>

<p>Does anyone at the Elephant &amp; Castle other than Lend Lease still believe in this regeneration?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/IMG_3290.JPG">
Southwark’s Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration plans were branded <strong> <em>“a miserable failure”</em> </strong> by former Heygate residents at a public inquiry into the Heygate Compulsory Purchase Order.</p>

<p>The Order was confirmed today after a six month wait following the four day inquiry, which took place during 5th - 8th Feb. The inquiry was triggered when remaining leaseholders on the Heygate estate objected to the Order, which will see them dispossessed of their homes to make way for the £1.5bn regeneration scheme being undertaken by the council and its development partner <a href="http://lendlease.com">Lend Lease</a>.</p>

<p>There were a total of <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/8118/core_document_6-objection_table">10 objectors to the Order</a>, including the Crossway church located on the estate plus a number of local residents and community groups. The objections broached a number of themes including lack of truly affordable housing, loss of trees and claims that the <a href="http://35percent.org/">plans had been altered</a> from the <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/2004SPG.pdf">original regeneration objectives</a> to the extent that they were no longer in the public interest.</p>

<p>The objectors lead by the Heygate Leaseholders Group, pointed out that tenants on the estate had not been given the opportunity to object, as those who objected had simply been subjected to eviction proceedings under the 1985 Landlord &amp; Tenant Act. They also pointed out that the scheme amounts to forced displacement - as the council had <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">denied Heygate residents a ballot</a> on whether their homes should be demolished. Several former Heygate residents <a href="http://heygate.github.com/img/CPOWitnessStatements.zip">gave evidence</a> at the inquiry objecting to Southwark’s heavy-handed approach when the <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/HAPtenantsletter.pdf">decant was brought forward in 2007</a> - 1 in 3 secure tenants were subjected to eviction proceedings<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, and its failure to honour promises to residents that they would be able to move to new homes on the estate footprint: the new ‘affordable’ units will be at the new ‘<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/05/social-rents-increases-break-up-communities">affordable rent</a>’, which will be at least double the level of council rents. Just 1 in 5 secure tenants on the estate have managed to stay living in the SE17 postcode, the rest have been scattered across the four corners of the borough and beyond:</p>

<p><a href="http://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=zp9B4NC378BY.kEuISBfzdwZE"><img src="http://heygate.github.io/img/DisplacedTenants.png"></a></p>

<p>The objectors were also supported by academic expert witnesses who gave evidence showing the negative effects of displacement on the community, and produced <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/tenurechangeanalysis.pdf">data</a> showing how the development plans - if passed - would create a far less mixed community at the Elephant &amp; Castle (just 8% social housing in total).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/IMG_3284.JPG" width="300" height="200">
Among the expert witnesses giving evidence were:</p>

<p><strong>Lorretta Lees</strong> - King’s College London</p>

<p><strong>Michael Edwards</strong> - Bartlett School of Planning (UCL)</p>

<p><strong>Mara Ferreri</strong> - Queen Mary University of London</p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Other witnesses giving evidence in support of the objectors included members of local groups <a href="http://betterelephant.org/">Better Elephant</a> and the <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/">Elephant Amenity Network</a>, Catherine Croft from the Twentieth Century Society and Tim Tinker the original Heygate architect.</p>

<p>In his submission, Tinker who spent 7 years drawing up the Heygate scheme in the 1960s said the following: <strong> <em>“The Heygate and its design has been stigmatised and I thought it was time to set the record straight. Its notorious reputation is a farrago of half-truths and lies put together by people who should have known better.”</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Tinker also pointed out that the original 1970s Heygate redevelopment had been based on providing homes for those displaced from a specific <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/NewingtonEstateSlumClearanceArea.png">neighbouring slum clearance area</a> (what is now the Newington estate). The original scheme he claimed, had kept the community together whereas the current scheme he said, had seen residents <strong> <em>&#8220;scattered to the four winds&#8221;</em> </strong>.</p>

<p>Michael Edwards who is a senior lecturer in the economics of planning at UCL&#8217;s Bartlett School of Planning said <strong> <em>&#8220;What is called &#8216;regeneration&#8217; typically has perverse, unintended, negative effects of displacing precisely those people whose deprivation was taken as the justification for regeneration.&#8221;</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></p>

<p>Lorretta Lees, who is Professor of Human Geography at King’s College London and an international expert on gentrification and urban regeneration policy said<strong> <em>&#8220;The development plans do not acknowledge the social mix already present on the estate, nor do they address issues of social sustainability. They deploy a language of social balance in the service of social exclusion. The rhetoric is about social sustainability, but confirmation of the CPO will lead to social segregation.&#8221;</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/examples/helen.jpg" width="250" height="250">In her <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/examples/HelenObrien.pdf">witness statement</a>, former chair of the Heyate Tenants and Residents Association Helen O’Brien described the redevelopment plans as a miserable failure - <strong> <em>“What was once a thriving community has now been scattered all over Southwark. Southwark&#8217;s regeneration plans are a miserable failure. Everyone who has worked on the regeneration at the Elephant should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.”</em> </strong></p>

<p>During the inquiry objectors produced detailed statistics including a <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">1998 Stock Condition Survey</a> and a council-commissioned <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey.html">Options Appraisal Study</a>, which had made recommendations for large parts of the estate to be refurbished as part of the redevelopment. They also produced a <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com/">detailed analysis</a> by global architects <a href="http://gensler.com/">Gensler</a>, showing how the estate could be refurbished and modernised at the current cost of just £14k per home.</p>

<p><a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf">Crime statistics</a> were also tabled by objectors in response to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87Yg_SJoPjw">council&#8217;s claim</a> that the bad design of the estate led to it becoming a <strong> <em>&#8220;by-word for social failure, crime and anti-social behaviour&#8221;</em> </strong>. The figures showed that the crime rate on the estate was a staggering 45% below the borough average.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/TerryRedpath.jpg" width="300" height="300">
Former Heygate Leaseholder Terry Redpath travelled in from Sidcup to give evidence at the inquiry. His submission highlighted the plight of leaseholders, many of which had been forced to relocate outside London with the low compensation paid for their homes - <strong> <em>&#8220;I could no longer afford to stay in the area - the compensation I was offered plus £45,000 of life savings bought me a terraced property 15 miles out of London. I have been forced to give up my home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors.”</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> </br> Redpath, who lived on the estate for 35 years and whose family have lived in the area for generations, went on to highlight the shortcomings of the consultation process:<br/>
<strong> <em>&#8220;Consultation was a farce - the council kept insisting that 94% of local residents supported the redevelopment plans, but we later learned that this was 94% of just 6% that had responded to the survey. They had originally promised us a ballot on whether the estate should be demolished but we never got it - it has been completely undemocratic.&#8221;</em> </strong></p>

Remaining leaseholder and statutory objector Adrian Glasspool said <strong> <em>“We have simply exercised our right to say no.

<p>When objectors asked at the inquiry why they didn&#8217;t get the new homes originally promised, the council&#8217;s lead officer replied <strong> <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I wasn&#8217;t employed by the council at the time the promises were made. But I am sure Lend Lease would be willing to sell to anyone&#8221;</em> </strong>:</p>

<p>Analysis of <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">information</a> received through FOI requests, shows that the average compensation received by leaseholders for a 1 bed flat on the estate was just £95,480.</p>

<p>Southwark Council is estimated to have spent around £3m obtaining the Compulsory Purchase Order.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Aclu-v-ashcroft-redacted.jpg">Southwark Council has accidentally published the details of its deal with global property giant Lend Lease for the £1.5bn regeneration of the Elephant &amp; Castle.<br/>
</br>
A redacted version of its confidential regeneration agreement was uploaded to the council’s website as part of its <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/02/03/heygate-objectors-to-be-heard-at-public-inquiry/">compulsory purchase proceedings</a> against remaining residents on the Heygate estate. But a classic schoolboy error has left it possible to copy and paste the blacked-out text straight out of the redacted document.</p>

<p></br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1287141619_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">The unintentional revelation comes after lengthy <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5869">proceedings to censure an opposition councillor</a>, who <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4879">claimed the agreement was poor value for money</a> after it was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4712">signed in July 2010</a>. The council leader&#8217;s response at the time was that land value payments had been reduced in favour of a guarantee of 25% affordable housing. However, the recently approved Heygate plans propose just 79 social rented homes out of a total 2,535.</p>

<p>The document shockingly reveals that Southwark Council is set to receive just £50m in return for the 22 acre site (See pages 6 &amp; 10 of the Agreement – (Heygate Headlease Premium £46m + Rodney Rd. Headlease Premium £4m). Other documents show that the council has already spent £65.5m on decanting the estate and progressing the redevelopment (See paragraph 50(ix) of <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/Lend_Lease_Response_to_LBS_Grounds_of_Appeal.pdf">Lend Lease&#8217;s appeal to the Information Tribunal</a>). This means it will be making a significant loss on the redevelopment of the site. The agreement does give the council a share of overage (profit left over after the developer has taken a 20% priority slice), but a report from the District Valuer shows a viability gap such that there is unlikely to be any overage(<a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/271840_1.pdf">see para. 150-153 of Officer Report 12/AP/1092</a>).</p>

<p>Critics of the scheme are claiming that the council&#8217;s political administration has sold the Elephant short in order to gain political advantage in honouring its manifesto pledge to deliver the regeneration after years of stalled negotiations. Others are pointing towards council leader <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,26174,185,00.htm">Peter John&#8217;s cosy relationship with the global property developer</a>.</p>

<p>The £50m sale price is astonishingly low considering that the council&#8217;s own <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/CILviabilitysite11.pdf">draft CIL viability study</a> estimated a gross development value of £990m for the Heygate site, and estimated that Lend Lease stands to make a £194m profit before any overage profit is shared.</p>

<p>Comparisons with other development sites at the Elephant show that the council is receiving well below market value for its land interest:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/heygatemap.jpg">The neighbouring Oakmayne/Tribeca Square 1.5 acre development site <a href="/images/OakmayneLandRegistry.pdf">exchanged hands on the open market in 2011 for £40m</a> – just £10m below the council&#8217;s deal for its 22 acre site.</p>

<p>The regeneration agreement also discloses that there have been no conditions written in to avoid the practice of &#8216;land banking&#8217;: this is where a developer sits on an empty development site for years, which appears on its balance sheet as an asset and is used as collateral to help keep financing low for other projects. In doing so, it also profits from purchasing land when prices are low and waiting for an upturn in the market before it capitalises on its investment.</p>

<p>Lend Lease is a seasoned professional at negotiating with inept public authorities, and has a long list of white elephants in its portfolio:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/public/assets/news_articles/2012/06/1340001815_peninsula-orig.jpg" width="300" height="200">In 2002 Lend Lease was <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-117850/Former-boss-slams-Dome-deal.html#axzz2JfClkPyR">given the Millenium Dome</a> and 170 acres of development land at Greenwich Peninsula. There was no fee, instead the Govt would <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2014020.stm">have a share in the profits</a>. However, a similarly precarious overage agreement was written up giving Lend Lease a priority £30m slice leaving little room for overage. Needless to say the Dome was sold on for £24m in 2009; the 170 acre surrounding site still hasn&#8217;t been developed; in 2012 Lend Lease sold its stake in the scheme for £100m having built just 239 of the 10,000 new homes proposed; a <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">report following a National Audit Office investigation</a> shows that there is going to be little chance of any overage.</p>

<p>In April 2012 Lend Lease was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/nyregion/lend-lease-expected-to-admit-to-fraud-scheme.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">convicted of fraud and fined</a> $56m US Dollars for over-billing authorities on public contracts in New York.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="http://www.afr.com/rw/Wires/Stories/2012-08-30/ASXAnnouncements/LLC_01328013.pdf">Aug 2012 annual financial report</a>, Lend Lease made $527m AUD - (£346m) profit before tax, and $620.8m AUD - (£334m) profit after tax in the financial year 2011/12.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/PeterJohnDanLabbadLendLease.jpg" width="400" height="300">The revelation confirms what Better Elephant <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/07/has-southwark-done-a-bum-deal-at-the-elephant/">has been saying all along</a>: Southwark has signed a really Bum Deal!</p>

<p>In the meantime the council have removed the badly redacted document from its website, but it has begun to appear in full unredacted form in other places including:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remaining residents on the Heygate estate have submitted their objections to the Compulsory Purchase Order ahead of the forthcoming public inquiry.</p>

<p>The public inquiry has been called in order for the Secretary of State to establish whether the public benefits of the development proposals sufficiently outweigh remaining residents&#8217; rights to their homes.</p>

<p>On Tuesday 5th Feb the Heygate objectors are due to appear at a public inquiry into the Compulsory Purchase Order, which will take place at 10am at Southwark council headquarters - 160 Tooley Street, London Bridge.</p>

<p>The Heygate Leaseholders Group has issued the following statement:</p>

<p>We are glad to have been able to exercise our right to object and be heard at a public inquiry. However, it is a shame that tenants on the estate were not given the same opportunity: those who did object were simply evicted under the 1985 Housing Act.</p>

<p>Our objection is that the core public benefits of the scheme originally proposed have been dropped from the current scheme, which now resembles a purely commercial development and therefore the Compulsory Purchase Order is not valid.</p>

<p>We will be outlining the shortcomings of the current proposals, which include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the replacement of 1,100 structurally-sound social housing units with 2,300 new homes of which only 71 will be social housing;</li>
<li>the lack of any firm guarantees that any of the 400 mature trees on site will be retained;</li>
<li>the lack of any renewable energy in the proposed development;</li>
<li>the high number of parking spaces (678) and increased provision for road traffic proposed, in what is supposed to be a car-free development;</li>
<li>proposals for the new development to be controlled and managed by a private company.</li>
</ul>


<p>We will also argue that the scheme has failed to deliver its promise to Heygate residents that they would be rehoused in the new development.</p>

<p>Tim Tinker, the original Heygate estate architect will be speaking in support of our objection. He will be arguing against the council&#8217;s claim that the estate was a design failure. There will also be other local residents and professionals speaking in support of our objection.</p>

<p>We will be quoting an opinion poll which showed that despite years of underinvestment, only 29% of residents were unhappy living on the estate and a majority were in favour of its refurbishment, along with crime statistics showing that the Heygate estate&#8217;s crime rate was nearly half the borough average.</p>
