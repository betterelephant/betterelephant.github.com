  <div class="entry-content"><p>In January 1998, Southwark Housing commissioned NBA Consortium Services to provide a comprehensive stock condition survey of its housing stock.</p>

<p>The Consortium delivered its report in May 1999. You can <a href="/images/nbasurvey1998.pdf">download a summary here.</a></p>

<iframe width="620" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://public.sheet.zoho.com/publish/adglasspool/copy-of-nbasurveyversion3-xls"> </iframe>


<p>The report showed the current condition of housing stock, and estimated costs for maintenance and repairs during the following 30 years.</p>

<p>It found that the average maintenance and repair cost for the entire 40,000 council-owned homes in the borough was estimated at an average of £10,653 per dwelling over 14 years and £23,363 over 30 years.</p>

<p>Top of the list was Gatebeck House in Pytchley rd, East Dulwich, which was estimated to require £147,518 per dwelling in repairs and maintenance over 30 years. This block had subisdence and was demolished in 1999. The site has since remained empty awaiting redevelopment.</p>

<p>Other buildings at the top of the list requiring substantial repairs were those on the Rockingham estate, which came in at around double the average estimate.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Heygate estate buildings came in way down the priority list, below average at just £21,742 per dwelling over 30 years, and the Aylesbury estate slightly above average at £23,502.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/strategic24June.pdf">Council papers</a> show that repair works have been deferred on the Heygate since as early as 1998, <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">this recently completed study</a> by global consulting firm <a href="http://www.gensler.com">Gensler</a> shows that the Heygate buildings are still in good condition and could still be fully refurbished for just £13,955 per home.</p>

<p>This prompts the question as to why they are being demolished?</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/u__9MOy0Uf4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Councillor Fiona Colley claims they are being bulldozed because the heating kept breaking down.</p>

<p>The 1,200 council homes on the Heygate used to provide the council with a rental income of around £5m per year. Had it re-invested some of this rental income in repairs then perhaps the heating wouldn&#8217;t have been breaking down?</p>

<p><a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/strategic24June.pdf">Council papers</a> cite a different reason for its demolition: <em>&#8220;an ugly and polluted environment and an unrecognised economic potential.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Well, some reckon that the replacement proposals look pretty ugly, and with the destruction of 400 mature trees the new environment is set to be more polluted than the current one.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/07/has-southwark-done-a-bum-deal-at-the-elephant/">questions are arising</a> as to whether the council is going to realise any economic benefit from the deal it struck with developer Lend Lease.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/305/demolition_begins_on_heygate_estate">This council press release</a> says the estate is being demolished because the bad design of its stairwells led to crime and anti-social behaviour. But <a href="https://sheet.zoho.com/public/adglasspool/heygateestatecrimestats-xls">these crime statistics</a> from the Met Police show that the Heygate&#8217;s crime rate was 45% below the borough average.</p>

<p>The council&#8217;s <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/what-s-the-deal-peter.html">Compulsory Purchase Order</a> on the other hand, says that the estate is being demolished because it is <em>&#8220;unpopular social housing.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The council&#8217;s Project Director Jon Abbott, says the Heygate and shopping centre need to be demolished because they are <em>&#8220;two big large structures preventing the E&amp;C from prospering from its location.&#8221;</em></p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_F08Ty9x7lE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Ah but, this video is from before the shopping centre owners and <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5430">TFL put a spanner in the works</a>.  The Northern roundabout is staying, so is the traffic and so is the shopping centre - albeit with a couple of <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/6135">skyscrapers thrown on top.</a></p>

<p>The way things stand, it looks like Lend Lease and the shopping centre owners will be the only ones prospering from the Elephant&#8217;s location!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="left" src="http://images.2ue.com.au/2010/03/10/1209561/Barangaroo_11-600x400.jpg" width="300" height="200">It emerged this week that Southwark Council&#8217;s development partner and global property giant &#8216;Lend Lease&#8217;, is being <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/valuation-dispute-poses-threat-to-1b-return-from-barangaroo-20121206-2ay9e.html">taken to court by state authorities</a> in Sydney over expected land payments for its Barangaroo development.</p>

<p>Taxpayers were originally promised that land value and $1bn AUS dollars in public spending necessary to assemble the site, would be paid back to the state government once the project is completed. This was part of the &#8216;profit-share&#8217; or &#8216;overage&#8217; agreement signed when the plans were drawn up. However, Lend Lease is now disputing how the land should be valued once construction has been completed.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/elephant_backside_shadow.png">This doesn&#8217;t bode well for Southwark taxpayers, who have already forked out <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s14567/Appendix%201%20-%20Regeneration%20spending%20detailed%20breakdown.pdf">at least £38m</a> in emptying the Heygate estate, and are about to put their hands in their pockets for a further <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SNJuly2012.jpg">£15m to pay for its demolition</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/Appendix_8.pdf">this report</a> from the council&#8217;s Finance Director in 2007, the deal with Lend Lease involves them reimbursing £20m towards the £32m cost of buying out the leaseholders on the Heygate, £20m towards demolition costs, and a fixed payment for the land of £10m.</p>

<p>So the council is set to receive a total of £50m reimbursement for site assembly, once the Heygate site has been cleared and handed over to Lend Lease - [by which time the council is likely to have spent nearly twice this amount on the task]. The rest of the money the council is expecting to receive from the deal is based on a &#8216;profit share&#8217; agreement, otherwise known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-sale_overage">&#8216;overage&#8217;</a>. However, it is important to understand that this 50% share of the profits comes only AFTER Lend Lease has taken a 20% &#8216;priority share&#8217; of the profits and a 4% management fee.</p>

<p>So it remains to be seen whether there will be anything left for the council at all in 2026 when the Heygate development is due to be completed.</p>

<p>These &#8216;profit share&#8217; or &#8216;overage&#8217; agreements are notoriously precarious, and can be subject to disputes over accounting methods as we are seeing now with Lend Lease&#8217;s Barangaroo development. They can also be compromised by delays to development, such as with Lend Lease&#8217;s Greenwich Peninsula scheme where the profit share expected from the scheme by authorities fell by £30m for each year the scheme was delayed. <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">(National Audit Office Report – 14 July 2008)</a></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/viabilityminutes.png" width="250" height="550">Exactly how much Southwark council is currently expecting to recoup from the profit-share agreement at the Elephant is unclear, as it has <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability/">rejected all calls</a> to publish any financial details relating to the development.</p>

<p>If the expected profit share is not enough to cover the costs it has incurred in emptying the estate, and the money it will have to cough up for the tube station capacity upgrade to support the new development, then it could end up making a substantial loss on the disposal of its 24-acre primely located Heygate site.<br/>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
The council currently <a href="/images/AssetManagementPlan.pdf">values its portfolio</a> of 39,000 residential properties at £954.7 per square metre (GIA - Gross Internal Area). At around a total (GIA) of 100,000 square metres, the 1,200 homes on the Heygate represent an asset to the council worth around £100m. So, even if you were to discount the development value of the land, the council should be expecting to recoup at least £250m in overage if it is going to break even and cover its costs from this development(£100m site assembly/£100m existing use value/£50m tube station capacity upgrade).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/CILviabilitysite11.pdf">2012 BNP Paribas site viability appraisal</a> of the Heygate development estimates gross profits at £194m. However, the appraisal doesn&#8217;t include the site assembly or infrastructure costs - these are expected to be around £150m. If we include these and subtract the developer&#8217;s 24% priority slice of the profits, then we are left with just £33m. Divided by two this leaves Southwark with just £16m - well below the Heygate site&#8217;s existing use value of £100m!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/ic.d35ff0997501d790fcceb51ab9a98eec.450x338x1280161383_62,o49,o27,o213,j.jpg" width="400" height="300">Questions relating to the council&#8217;s expected return from the deal were tabled at the council leader at the <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=26613">Overview &amp; Scrutiny Committee on 2 Nov</a>, but there has still been no response.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5314">Suggestions</a> have also been made that the current deal with Lend Lease is a breach of EU competition Law. In 2007 when Lend Lease <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/1539">won the bidding competition</a> to redevelop the Elephant &amp; Castle, the tendering brief included delivery of the new leisure centre and demolition of the shopping centre. Now that these are no longer included in the deal, the regeneration contract should be re-procured or else it could end up being challenged in court under the EU Treaty on State Aid.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/images/20khouse_02.gif">In April 2012, Building Trust International launched the <a href="http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/homecompetition.html">HOME competition</a> - a project focused on providing residents most at risk in developed cities with a safe place to live. The competition&#8217;s task was to create an urban dwelling for under £20k, and it resulted in over 450 applications.</p>

<p>One of the applications was an entry from <a href="http://www.gensler.com/">Gensler</a>, a global architecture consulting firm. Gensler produced a detailed report showing how it could be possible to refurbish the Heygate estate for just £14,000 per unit - costing in total less than half of what it has already cost just to empty the estate.</p>

<p>At the beginning of November, we contacted Gensler who gave us permission to display one of its presentation slides on the Better Elephant website. However, last week Gensler contacted Better Elephant to request the presentation slide to be taken back down.</p>

<p>Being just marginally above the £13,000 grant available under the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/empty-homes">HCA Empty Homes Grants Programme</a>, one can see why the <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">Gensler proposals</a> are interesting for community-led regeneration schemes like Better Elephant, and we were dissapointed to have had to remove the Gensler Heygate slides.</p>

<p>Gensler, were recently <a href="http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/design-team-named-for-olympic-international-quarter/8625976.article">selected by Lend Lease</a> to help design its new £1.3 billion commercial district on the edge of the Olympic Park in Stratford City.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/12/1352720042109/homeless1.jpg" width="400" height="300">The Gensler Heygate entry won an honourable mention, but the winner of the competition was architect consultancy Levitt Bernstein with its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/nov/12/garages-housing-homeless-people">&#8216;pop-up&#8217; garage proposal</a> which would allow an 11.5sq m bedsit to be created within a disused garage for around £13,000. <br/>
</br>
With over 1,000 garages on the Heygate estate this would double the number of homes on the site without any structural modifications. We wonder if Levitt Bernstein will be putting forward this proposal in <a href="http://www.levittbernstein.co.uk/architecture/housing/totters-court">its masterplan</a> for the forthcoming Aylesbury estate regeneration..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Better Elephant has made a formal application to the Secretary of State under the new <a href="http://www.emptyhomes.com/what-you-can-do-2/resources/prods-2/">Community Right to Reclaim Land powers</a>. The community-led regeneration group is requesting that the Heygate estate is released from its current contractual deadlock and put back into use.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2010/11/dzn_Heygate-Abstracted-by-Simon-Kennedy-1.jpg" width="300" height="400">The Secretary of State can order public authorities to dispose of empty property or land. The powers are part of wider developments under the new Localism Act, which aims to shift the balance of power away from the centre to local communities.</p>

<p>The Community Right to Reclaim Land allows anyone to request that a specific area of publicly-owned land is put up for sale on the open market.</p>

<p>This can be on grounds that there are no suitable development plans in place or likely to be put in place in an acceptable period of time.</p>

<p>The Better Elephant Group are arguing that the current development plans for the Heygate estate are not going to be implemented in an accetable period of time [completion not due until 2026].</p>

<p>The group claims that this is a &#8216;land banking&#8217; exercise conducted by developers, which enables them to use the land as a long-term asset to shore-up their balance sheets. According to <a href="http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/8421/we-must-fix-it-delivering-reform-of-the-building-sector-to-meet-the-uks-housing-and-economic-challenges">a recent IPPR report</a> this is common practice among the big developers, and there are currently 170,000 homes in London with planning permission that are not under construction.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/oakmayne.jpg">The Heygate&#8217;s neighbouring Oakmayne/Tribeca development is one such example where planning permission was granted for over 500 homes due to be completed by 2009. The site is still standing empty behind a wall of decaying wooden hoarding. <br/>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
The &#8216;land banking&#8217; practice also enables developers to drip-feed the market: it slowly releases its flats for sale - keeping prices high and avoiding flooding the market.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/el19_921.jpg">The effect on surrounding communities is devastating: 170 businesses are currently on the verge of bankruptcy according to business support network <a href="http://bizextra.biz/about">&#8216;Business Extra&#8217;</a> on Walworth rd. Such practices drive out retailers and lead to long term blight of an area.</p>

<p>The delay is also a waste of public funds in the loss of rent and council tax incurred by the council.</p>

<p>It also cuts into the council&#8217;s expected returns from the regeneration partnership: because the council&#8217;s return for its land interest is based entirely on overage (profit after the developer has sold the new homes and taken a priority share), delay to the housing development erodes the financial returns, since the present value of future income is lower when received later in time compared to income received earlier, because of the time value of money and the greater risks involved.</p>

<p>This was also the finding of a <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">National Audit Office report</a>, when an investigation was launched after questions were raised about the Lend Lease Greenwich Peninsula regeneration deal in 2008.</p>

<p>Better Elephant&#8217;s refurbishment plans will be facilitated by a Community Land Trust, which is not profit driven and will oversee the refurbishment of the buildings to ensure a more equitable revitalisation of the Elephant &amp; Castle without waiting another 15 years.</p>

<p>We have also applied for a slice of the <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/repairs/minister-invites-bids-for-%C2%A3300m-empty-homes-fund/6524789.article">recently announced £300m Empty Homes Fund</a> designed to &#8216;stop the rot&#8217; and bring empty homes back into use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Having been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19371334">served with a Compulsory Purchase Order</a> by Southwark Council, Heygate leaseholders have fought back by submitting an objection to the Secretary of State. You can <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/heygate_leaseholders_cpo_objection_template.pdf">view the objection here</a>. What the legal jargon basically says is that the regeneration scheme originally promised a number of <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5430">significant public infrastructure improvements</a>, that these have been dropped and that the scheme now resembles a purely commercial development. Therefore CPO powers are not appropriate as there are no public benefits to the scheme.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/418865_406280396101674_377969546_n.jpg?w=500&h=333" width="400" height="300">The Council&#8217;s original &#8216;Statement of Reasons&#8217; in which it makes the case for the CPO can be <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/what-s-the-deal-peter.html">downloaded here.</a>  The document makes interesting reading.</p>

<p>The leaseholders group are currently in the process of organising their &#8216;Statement of Case&#8217; against the CPO. This will also be published online once it has been submitted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the group have published their objections to the planning application for the Heygate redevelopment:</p>

<p><strong>Objection to revised Heygate Outline Planning Application - 12/AP/1092</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Affordable Housing -</strong>
Whilst the new revised housing statement does now include a minimum target of 25% affordable housing, it is not proposing the type of affordable housing required by planning policy or negotiated in the Regeneration Agreement. Both the local planning policy and the Regeneration Agreement state clearly that half of all affordable housing must be social rented. This is not the case with this application which has substituted the new ‘affordable rent’ tenure in its place. These new ‘affordable rents’ are anything but affordable and are beyond the means of most of our former neighbours here on the Heygate estate. As a result there will be insufficient social-rented homes in the new development for Southwark to be able to honour its promise to rehouse former Heygate residents in the new homes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the planning application makes no provision for the retained equity homes which it was originally agreed would be offered to Heygate leaseholders like ourselves. The result is that we are being priced out of our community and that we have been asked to give up our homes on the back of promises which have not been kept. Only a limited number of former Heygate tenants will now be able to return; the exact number is unclear, but phase one of the Heygate development provides an indicator where the detailed application has now been submitted for 235 new homes, only 8 of which will be social rented.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/gatedcommunity.png" width="350" height="493">This is an insult to the 3,500 former Heygate community who were told they would be able to return to new homes on the site. It will result in the creation of a private gated community for the wealthy, and will lead to further segregation between the capital’s ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’. This is further exacerbated by the <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years/">planning application’s Estate Management Strategy</a>, which proposes that the entire 10 hectare footprint comes under the control of a privately-managed ‘Estate Management Company’ patrolled by a private ‘Town Centre Security Team’.</p>

<p></br>
</br>
</br>
<strong>2. Sustainability -</strong>
The Elephant &amp; Castle&#8217;s existing Energy Centre used to supply heating &amp; hot water to homes on both the Heygate and neighbouring Salisbury Row estates and a housing development on Rodney Road.</p>

<p><img src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/HeygateDHN.png"></p>

<p>Up until January 2011, the regeneration masterplan promised to replace this with an Energy Centre which would supply up to 10,000 homes in the entire E&amp;C area with renewable energy. This was part of the ambitious ‘zero carbon’ growth initiative endorsed by Bill Clinton.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M9H_K3msMSc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>However, this strategy now appears to have been abandoned in its entirety: the outline planning application makes no commitment to any renewable energy whatsoever. It proposes a replacement district heating network significantly smaller than the existing one, which supplies only those homes included in this planning application. It fails to make a firm commitment to supply any new homes on the first phase of the Heygate redevelopment or any other developments in the area; moreover there will be insufficient capacity to do so.</p>

<p>Whilst there are two energy efficient Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants proposed within the Energy Centre they will be of relatively small capacity (1248 kW in total), and CHP will only be meet half of the total heating requirements of the new development. The other half will be met by good old-fashioned gas boilers.</p>

<p>Biomethane gas would make this a greener option but the supply is still in doubt. It won&#8217;t be produced on-site or off-site by Lend Lease. The gas will come from the national grid but will be paid for at a premium: a bit like green tariff electricity. Whether you will actually be able to get biomethane will depend on whether there is enough being injected into the grid. There are currently no operational biomethane plants injecting into the UK gas grid. Despite this, Lend Lease claim that there is a possibility that 15% of the gas supply could be supplied by biomethane by 2020.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/energy9.png" width="400" height="400">It is also a surprise to learn that there is no guarantee that the new Energy Centre will be connected to the Phase 1 development. The separate Phase 1 application proposes having its own separate Energy Centre - again reliant on gas boilers with CHP providing just half of its total heating requirements. The outline planning application also optimistically lists 14 other sites including Phase 1 that could &#8216;possibly&#8217; be linked at some future date. But this would only be possible by installing significant extra plant. However, questions still remain as to whether there is enough room in the Energy Centre for extra plant and who would pay for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"><img src="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2270">The fabled &#8216;MUSCo&#8217;</a> was going to provide 10,000 homes with renewable energy. It was a pioneering scheme endorsed by Bill Clinton as a global example of &#8216;carbon zero&#8217; development. The ambitious plans proposed a biomass CHP plant generating green heat and power from organic waste. It was also going to provide a bore-hole for a green water supply and an automated vacuum waste collection system moving municipal waste through underground tunnels.</p>

<p>Now it would appear that Lend Lease have submitted applications which barely connect one side of the estate with the other.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/aerial.png"> <strong>Tree Strategy</strong>-</p>

<p>The planning application’s Tree Strategy is equally ambiguous and non committal. Whilst it identifies a number of trees for &#8216;possible retention&#8217;, the application&#8217;s small print contains the following caveat: “As many of the best of the existing mature trees will be retained where possible” subject to ‘further more detailed testing” at later design stages.
The application therefore makes no firm commitment to retain any of the 400 mature trees on the existing site.</p>

<p><strong>3. Transport -</strong>
In the past two and a half years, nearly 300 people have been killed or injured on the roads in and around the Elephant &amp; Castle. Since Christmas 2011, 4 pedestrians have died including most recently a 5 year old boy. The danger to all but most clearly to pedestrians and cyclists is endemic and long standing, owing to the domination of the area by vehicle traffic.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1311085254_80.177.117.97.jpg">The original regeneration plans included proposals to tackle this problem by creating a pedestrianised ‘Civic Square’, which would span across the Northern roundabout connecting the two tube stations and creat a pedestrian precinct.
The Northern roundabout is officially the most dangerous traffic interchange for cyclists in London and cannot be crossed by pedestrians without negotiating a labyrinth of subways.</p>

<p>However, the final masterplan application now appears to have dropped all plans to reduce car domination: the civic square has been shelved, and it is actually proposing to reduce the size of the roundabout in order to increase the width of the vehicle traffic lanes: “Part of the overall central island removed within the vicinity of access for the electricity substation to accommodate improved circulation and better lane discipline on the internal gyratory, with amendments also along the eastern side to better accommodate the full five lanes” (Section 11: pg. 104)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/cyclebypass.png">In addition, - despite strong objections from City Hall - the application proposes to block TFL’s plans for a much needed eastern cycle bypass as part of the proposed Cycle Superhighway 6 (Penge to the City):</p>

<p>“A route for the new cycle superhighway (CS6) is not intended to be provided through the proposed Development. At the heart of the Proposed development is the provision of a new Park, a place for people to visit and enjoy as a leisure activity. The Proposed development is therefore designed to support leisure cyclists rather than being used as a cycling commuter route through the development which may discourage less confident cyclists and conflict with pedestrian movement.” (Transport Statement - 6.8.2)</p>

<p>Thus, not only is the application proposing to widen the E&amp;C roundabout to provide an extra lane of vehicle traffic, it is also opposing plans for a much-needed cycle bypass avoiding a key collision blackspot.</p>

<p>Beyond this it is also planning to create 678 new parking spaces at the Elephant: “The Development will provide a maximum of 616 car parking spaces. A maximum of 62 car parking spaces could be provided on street.” (Transport Statement -15.1.2) This is a breach of planning policy, entirely unnecessary in a zone 1 public transport hub, and wholly incompatible with claims of delivering a car-free sustainable development.</p>

<p><strong>4. Timescale -</strong>
The planning application proposes that the development will be built in phases and will not be fully completed until 2026. The original Heygate development was completed in 1974 and took just 4 years to complete. The delay is unacceptable and will lead to long-term blight affecting residents and businesses in the area. The reasons for the delay are commercial rather than technical and are based on well-established speculative &#8216;land banking&#8217; practices employed by developers. The long delay allows the developer to benefit from speculative land value increases, and is also used to shore up its balance sheet with the land appearing in its accounts as an asset. This increases its credit ratings and lowers its borrowing costs on other projects.
The applicant&#8217;s track record here is an unforunate sign of what is likely to befall the Elephant if this planning application is approved:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In 2001 it signed a Regeneration Agreement for 150 acres of land at Greenwich Peninsula.</p></li>
<li><p>An anxious political administration is forced to make significant concessions on planning obligations in the 3 years before outline planning is finally granted in 2004.</p></li>
<li><p>8 years pass without any development whatsoever until Lend Lease sells the land in June 2012 to Hong Kong developer &#8216;Knight Dragon&#8217;. This site remains undeveloped.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, the estimated profit share expected to be clawed back from the scheme by the Authorities falls by around £30m for each year the scheme is further delayed. <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">(National Audit Office Report – 14 July 2008)</a></p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 1968, the decision was taken to demolish the original tenement buildings and owner-occupied terraced housing to make way for the Heygate estate.</p>

<p>The reasons given for the redevelopment were the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The main problems to be overcome are the replacement of densely populated and obsolete tenement buildings which have low environmental standards, with redevelopment in a manner commensurate with today&#8217;s needs and standards.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Paragraph 2.2.1</strong><cite>1968 Heygate Estate Planning Brief</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>It has since been accepted that the victorian buildings were structurally sound and that they would be very sought after today had they been retained:</p>

<p>In April 2011, Southwark council acknowledged the Heygate estate buildings were structurally sound, and released the following press statement in justifying its demolition:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much has been learned since the designs of the 1960s. As time has passed, the estate has become increasingly expensive to maintain and heat and is no longer an ideal place for people to live compared with standards that are expected today.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Southwark Council</strong><cite>Press Release April 2011</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Now questions are being asked as to why did <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey.html">80.3% of its residents say that they didn&#8217;t want to move off the estate</a>if it was not an ideal place for people to live?</p>

<p>The event was hosted by the (provisional) Heygate Residents Association which screened the film ‘Doreen’ made by film-makers David Reeve &amp; Patrick Steel.</p>

<p>In the film, Doreen Gee - former Chair of the Tenants &amp; Residents Association - reminisces about the culture of the estate and what went wrong with the regeneration.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/heygate_cinema2.JPG" width="400" height="300">The evening was curated by Jerry Flynn, former estate resident and local campaigner. Doreen and both of the film-makers attended the event, which was followed by an animated discussion around the regeneration and wider housing issues. The audience included a number of former Heygate residents and residents from the neighbouring Aylesbury estate, who were treated to a bowl of hot soup and refreshments following the lively discussion.</p>

<p>The film was accompanied by a number of newsclips about the estate (see below) and an excerpt from the film-makers’ new feature-length documentary about the regeneration of the estate (Larry &amp; Janet).</p>
