    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/dec/27/1"><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/novote.png" width="350" height="200"></a>There are a few subtle differences between the Heygate and the Aylesbury regeneration schemes. The first is that Heygate residents were <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/councilrulesoutvote.pdf">denied a ballot</a> on the future of their estate, whereas Aylesbury residents were fully balloted. Page 2 of <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/Data/Executive/20050927/Agenda/Item%2007%20-%20The%20AylesburyEstate%20Revised%20Strategy%20-%20Report.pdf">This 2005 Council Executive Committee report</a> shows the results of the ballot:</p>

<p><img src="http://betterelephant.org/images/ballot.png"></p>

<p>Further down in the report, the Council tries to speculate as to the reasons behind the residents&#8217; comprehensive rejection of its redevelopment plans:</p>

<p><img src="http://betterelephant.org/images/aylesburyballot.png"></p>

<p>Note the Council&#8217;s observation that <strong> <em>&#8220;some residents didn&#8217;t believe the new Housing Association would be able to keep its commitments on rents and service charges&#8221;</em> </strong>.</p>

<p>We are now starting to see that residents&#8217; early concerns about rent increases were very well founded. In the <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/279910_1.pdf">legal agreement</a> for the <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/lq-wins-work-on-next-phase-of-aylesbury-plan/6522708.article">most recent phase</a> of the Aylesbury scheme to be granted planning approval, the definition of social rented housing refers to the London Plan and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-the-rented-housing-sector--2/supporting-pages/providing-affordable-homes-for-rent">HCA definition</a> of affordable rented housing of up to 80% market rents:</p>

<p><img src="http://35percent.org/images/wolvertons106SR.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/41_LBSouthwark_Session3.pdf"><img class="right" src="http://35percent.org/images/SouthwarkMarketRents.png" width="350" height="350"></a>So whilst tenants will have the right to return to a new housing association property in the scheme, the new &#8216;social&#8217; housing rents will be significantly higher than the existing Council rents.</p>

<p>This table from the Council&#8217;s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/41_LBSouthwark_Session3.pdf">June 2014 Affordable Rent Product Study</a> shows Southwark&#8217;s market rent figures for a 1-bed flat at £289 per week for the Aylesbury postcode (SE17). 80% of this will well over double the existing Council rents on the estate and affordable to very few existing Council tenants.</p>

<h2>Refurbishment vs Demolition</h2>

<p><a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s43556/Report%20Selection%20of%20a%20Preferred%20Partner%20to%20Work%20with%20the%20Council%20to%20Deliver%20the%20Regeneration%20of%20the.pdf">Council briefing papers</a> show that the Council is estimated to be spending a staggering £150m emptying and demolishing the Aylesbury estate.</p>

<p><a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s43556/Report%20Selection%20of%20a%20Preferred%20Partner%20to%20Work%20with%20the%20Council%20to%20Deliver%20the%20Regeneration%20of%20the.pdf"><img src="http://betterelephant.org/images/150m.png"></a></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/SixAcresRegeneration.png" width="300" height="300">As we pointed out in our <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2014/07/11/london-assembly-investigation-into-housing-estate-refurbishment-and-demolition/">previous blog post</a>, other London boroughs are making better use of their scarce resources. Islington has an estate called the Six Acres estate near Finsbury Park. The Six Acres estate was built at the same time as Heygate &amp; Aylesury, by the same contractors (Laing) using the same system (Jespersen 12M).</p>

<p>Instead of demolshing its estate and handing it over to the private sector at a loss, Islington Council chose to refurbish the Six Acres estate in 2012. The 473 homes on the estate were refurbished with <a href="http://www.lawtechltd.co.uk/Project_Tollington.aspx">new external wall insulation</a>, new entry doors, exterior furnishing improvements, <a href="http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study.pdf">green roofs</a> and <a href="http://greenroofshelters.co.uk/green-roofed-cycle-shelters-for-islington/">cycle shelters</a>.</p>

<p>The entire Six Acres estate refurbishment and public realm improvement works cost a total of just £5.15m. This works out at around £10k per dwelling; far less than the circa £60k per dwelling that Southwark Council is spending on emptying and demolshing the Aylesbury estate (£150m/2500 homes).</p>

<p>Extensive <a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/engineering-exchange/demolition-refurbishment-social-housing/">research by the University College London</a> and <a href="https://heygateestate.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/genslerheygate.pdf">case studies</a> by leading architects has shown that refurbishment is better not just financially, but also socially and environmentally.</p>

    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2014/10/19/gamekeepers-turned-poachers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/yacht-cannes-selling-homes-local-government-officials-mipim">international property fair <strong>MIPIM</strong></a> wasn&#8217;t just for developers and councils, it was also for those who help developers lobby councils. <a href="http://www.fourcommunications.com/"><strong>Four Communications</strong></a> is one such company. It says it offers teams of experts who <em>&#8220;provide support at every stage of the planning, marketing and communications process&#8221;</em> and helps to secure <a href="https://www.fourcommunications.com/work-gallery/helping-secure-new-community-stadium"><em>&#8220;political support in the face of public opposition&#8221;</em></a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://my.mipim.com/online-database/mipim/companies/#search=d%3D101990%7C0F%26startRecord%3D205%26rpp%3D12"><img src="http://crappistmartin.github.io/images/FourMipimStand.png"></a></p>

<p>Who are these &#8216;experts&#8217; able to magically gain the &#8216;political support&#8217; of council members in developments facing public opposition?  Well, who better than council members themselves?</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.fourcommunications.com/sites/default/files/styles/four_square/public/people/jeremy.png?itok=IDqYOvmA"><strong>Four Communications</strong> was <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm">founded</a> in 2001 by former (Labour) Southwark council leader Jeremy Fraser. On its payroll and <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/OneStopReport.pdf">list of shareholders</a> are former (Labour) Lambeth council leader <a href="http://www.fourcommunications.com/who-we-are/our-people/jim-dickson">Jim Dickson</a> (who is also a <a href="http://moderngov.lambeth.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=165">sitting Lambeth councillor</a>) and Southwark&#8217;s former (Labour) Cabinet Member for Regeneration Steve Lancashire<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>The South Bank&#8217;s King&#8217;s Reach Tower provides a good example of how <strong>Four Communications</strong>&#8217; lobbying service works. In 2010, Developer <a href="http://www.cit.co.uk/"><strong>CIT</strong></a> employed <strong>Four</strong> to &#8216;help&#8217; get permission for its controversial 41 storey Blackfriars development. This is how <strong>Four</strong>&#8217;s 4 step lobbying process was implemented:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Four</strong>&#8217;s Steve Lancashire sets up meetings with his Southwark Labour cronies Peter John (council leader) and Fiona Colley (Cabinet Member for Regeneration).
<a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/152101_1.pdf"><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://betterelephant.github.com/images/FourCommunicationsMeetingsCouncilMembers.png' width='' height='' title='Extract from page 6 of King's Reach SCI produced by Four Communications'><span class='caption-text'>Extract from page 6 of King&#8217;s Reach SCI produced by Four Communications</span></span></a></li>
<li>The old friends agree to nod through the development despite its numerous planning policy breaches like the lack of any on-site affordable housing.</li>
<li>The council leader and regen boss brief their planning officers instructing them to recommend the application to the (heavily whipped) planning committee.</li>
<li><strong>Four</strong> conducts a bogus consultation and produces a <a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/152101_1.pdf">&#8216;Statement of Community Involvement&#8217;</a>, providing phony evidence that local residents support the application.</li>
</ol>


<p>Every major planning application requires a Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) to demonstrate that the developer has consulted with the local community and that its plans have public support. <strong>Four</strong> has helped developers obtain permission and produced SCIs for an impressive list of (social housing-free) developments in Southwark. The table below provides links to the SCIs created by <strong>Four</strong> for each of the following developments which it helped obtain permission:</p>

Unsurprisingly most of these agreed to the vague and narrowly-framed questions aimed at restricting any kind of meaningful consultation:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;The design of the scheme should be of the highest quality&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Any new proposals should be environmentally friendly&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;It is important that local residents continue to be consulted as plans move forward&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>


<p>The planning application was duly nodded through and Strata Tower - entirely without social rented housing but complete with useless wind turbines - was built.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='http://betterelephant.github.com/images/dimoldenberg.jpg' width='300' height='300' title='Private Eye (issue 1380 - 25 Nov 2014)'><span class='caption-text'>Private Eye (issue 1380 - 25 Nov 2014)</span></span>It is worth noting that the council&#8217;s E&amp;C regeneration partner Lend Lease, is absent from the list of <strong>Four</strong>&#8217;s clients. That&#8217;s because Lend Lease employs a different PR company called <a href="http://www.quatro-pr.co.uk/"><strong>Quatro</strong></a> to handle PR for its developments. It&#8217;s also worth noting that <strong>Quatro</strong>&#8217;s Managing Director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/paul-dimoldenberg/a/5b5/b44">Paul Dimoldenberg</a>, is a former senior Southwark council officer and current leader of the Labour group on Westminster city council.</p>

<p></br>
</br>
</br>
As covered in a <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/04/09/report-uncovers-corruption-at-the-elephant/">previous post</a>, Southwark&#8217;s former Lib Dem and Conservative leaders have shown no greater integrity and are both now helping developers obtain planning permission for developments in Southwark. But what makes the Labour leaders&#8217; double-dealing particularly dangerous is their political strangleholds in Southwark and Lambeth: the lack of any opposition party provides the leaders with a free hand to wave all these developments through unscrutinised.</p>

<p>Southwark and Lambeth&#8217;s corrupt Labour clique has given a whole new meaning to the New Labour mantra of <strong>&#8220;inclusive prosperity&#8221;</strong>.</p>

    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2014/07/11/london-assembly-investigation-into-housing-estate-refurbishment-and-demolition</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsMSNi1IEAEATUy.jpg:large" width="300" height="200">Last Friday saw the second meeting of the London Assembly&#8217;s <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-assembly/london-assembly/investigations/demolition-and-refurbishment-of-social-housing-estates-in-london">investigation</a> into the refurbishment and demoliton of council estates. The first meeting in June had heard from regeneration industry &#8216;specialists&#8217;, who caused a stir when Stephen McDonald, Southwark&#8217;s former head of regeneration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-olUu1wHqA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h6m16s">boasted</a> about winning an award for &#8216;emptying&#8217; the Heygate of its residents in under a year. Stephen is now working for Barnet Council emptying the West Hendon estate of its residents.</p>

<p>Last week&#8217;s meeting gave the opportunity for an alternative perspective and for those directly affected by regeneration schemes to have their say. Among the highlights from speakers at the meeting were:</p>

<p>Roy Kindle - formerly of Greenwich Council who said: <a href="http://youtu.be/laCg-kfcpIE?t=1h6m33s"><em>&#8220;10 years ago residents on the Ferrier estate were told that they would have the right to come back, but what Greenwich didn&#8217;t mention is that they would need to win the lottery to do so.&#8221;</em></a></p>

<p>Richard Lee from the <a href="http://justspace.org.uk/">Just Space Network</a> who explained that <a href="http://youtu.be/laCg-kfcpIE?t=1h21m44s"><em>&#8220;decisions to demolish seem to be based on some kind of ideological, policy-driven agenda rather than a robust cost/benefit analysis - technical reports very rarely look at the question of embodied carbon.&#8221;</em></a></p>

<p>Chris Jofeh, Director of <a href="http://arup.com">Arup</a> (the consulting engineers who were involved in the original Heygate construction and also the redevelopment) claimed that <a href="http://youtu.be/laCg-kfcpIE?t=1h50m15s"><em>&#8220;Demolition and rebuild emits a super amount of carbon dioxide and even if you build super-efficient new homes it could take 30 years before you redress the balance. If we do take carbon targets seriously then refurbishment is an option which is much more likely to achieve those targets.&#8221;</em></a></p>

<p>Twice during the meeting the question was asked &#8220;can anybody give a positive example of regeneration?&#8221;; unfortunately the answer was silence accompanied by widespread shoulder shrugging.</p>

<p>This is a problem, particularly when the issue is polarised around the two opposed camps of refurbishment versus demolition. In the context of the seemingly universal agreement around housing shortages and the need for density increases, this can lead to equally universal <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2013/feb/13/elephant-and-castle-southwark-council-regeneration-rights-and-wrongs">claims</a> that there is no alternative to the Heygate &amp; Aylesbury-style wholesale discounted disposal option.</p>

<p>What these polarised perspectives miss are the plethora of possibilities inbetween the two poles of refurbishment versus demolition. For example, in 1998 Southwark Council commissioned consulting engineers &#8216;Allot &amp; Lomax&#8217; (now part of the <a href="http://www.jacobs.com/">Jacobs</a> group) to conduct a survey and <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">options appraisal study</a> for the Heygate estate. The engineers declared all of the buildings structurally sound but recommended that 6 of the estate&#8217;s 19 blocks be demolished and redeveloped to fit in with the Council&#8217;s plan to increase density, permeability and tenure mix; the remaining 13 blocks they recommended for refurbishment.</p>

<p>However, Southwark rejected the consultants&#8217; recommendations on the grounds that <em>&#8220;it was recognised at the time that changing land values could make the complete demolition and redevelopment by the private sector a better option.&#8221;</em><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></p>

<p>We are now 15 years on from this decision and are just beginning to be able to evaluate its social, economic and environmental outcomes:</p>

<p><strong>Economic:</strong> Southwark Council has spent far more on &#8216;decanting&#8217; the estate than expected. By Jan 2013 it had incurred capital and revenue costs totalling £65m<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.<br/>
<strong>Social:</strong> the social impact of the scheme and its failure to provide the new homes promised to Heygate residents has been widely <a href="http://heygate.github.io">documented</a>.<br/>
<strong>Environmental:</strong> the continued emphasis on the operative carbon emission comparisons between Heygate buildings and its intended replacements entirely disavows the question of embodied carbon, i.e. the carbon emitted from the construction of materials contained both in existing buildings and their replacements. <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">This</a> 2012 report by <a href="http://gensler.com">Gensler</a> &amp; <a href="http://baqus.co.uk">Baqus</a> shows that 40,000 tonnes of C02 emissions could have been saved by the estate&#8217;s refurbishment.</p>

<p>So what might the Heygate have looked like had the Council followed the advice of its consultants?</p>

<p><a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/SixAcresRegeneration.png"><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/SixAcresRegeneration.png" width="300" height="300"></a>Islington&#8217;s Six Acres estate in Finsbury park was built in 1969 - five years before the Heygate and Aylesbury.<br/>
In 2011 Islington Council passed plans for the regeneration of the estate. In 2012 the plans were implemented commencing with the demolition of one of the maisonette blocks containing 72 social rented homes. That part of the site along with the former car park, was sold for £8.4m to <a href="http://onehousinggroup.co.uk">&#8216;One Housing Group&#8217;</a> who built 164 new homes comprising a <a href="http://planning.islington.gov.uk/NorthgatePublicDocs/00195878.pdf">mix</a> of 82 private, 65 social rented and 17 intermediate units. All new homes were equipped with solar hot water and ground-source heat pumps. The remaining 9 blocks on the estate comprising 473 council homes were refurbished with <a href="http://www.lawtechltd.co.uk/Project_Tollington.aspx">new external wall insulation</a>, new entry doors, exterior furnishing improvements, <a href="http://www.langley.co.uk/asx/six_acres_case_study.pdf">green roofs</a> and <a href="http://greenroofshelters.co.uk/green-roofed-cycle-shelters-for-islington/">cycle shelters</a>.</p>

<p>Disregarding the demolition and construction cost of the new homes, the refurbishment and landscaping works amounted to a total cost of just £5.15m. This works out at around £10k per dwelling, far less than the circa £50k per dwelling that Southwark Council has spent on emptying the Heygate estate.</p>

    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2013/09/30/getting-paid-to-demolish-the-heygate</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been a lot of crowing by Council Regeneration Boss Fiona Colley recently, about how many jobs the regeneration will bring.<br/>
In her <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2013/sep/23/elephant-castle-regeneration-heygate-estate#start-of-comments">letter</a> published in last week&#8217;s Guardian, she claims that the regeneration will deliver <strong> <em>&#8220;5,000 jobs, giving local people genuine opportunities to develop skills and earn a decent income.&#8221;</em> </strong></p>

<p>She was subsequently busy on Twitter asking if anybody was interested in <strong> <em>&#8216;getting paid to demolish the Heygate&#8217;</em> </strong>:
<img class="center" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/TwitterConversation.jpg"></p>

<p>One user replied to Cllr Colley with the question &#8216;will these jobs be for locals?&#8217; Better Elephant pointed out the fact that <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=20296">Southwark is paying £15m</a> to Lend Lease to demolish the estate, and asked whether the jobs would be paying the London Living Wage?</p>

<p>Cllr Colley failed to respond to either question.</p>

<p>The questions are pertinent in view of the large sums of public money flowing into what is essentially a private development. Southwark has already spent a total of £65m in just emptying the estate and progressing its redevelopment<a href="See">^1</a>; it is about to spend a further £15m paying Lend Lease to demolish it, and the question of whether any of this will flow into the hands of local people after Lend Lease and Keltbray have taken their cut is a valid one.</p>

<p>In finding an answer we could look at a case study example of how regeneration contracts have benefited local people so far:</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/heygate_estate_costs">this FOI request</a>, Southwark council has spent £1.28m on private security for the Heygate estate over the past 4 years. We don&#8217;t have an exact breakdown of the costs, but <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/elephant_and_castle_council_esta">we do know</a> that in April 2008 a contract was awarded to a company called <em>&#8216;Safe Estates Services Ltd&#8217;</em> to provide regular night-time security for the estate in exchange for the sum of £13,500 per month. Companies House <a href="http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?link=51">records</a> show that <em>Safe Estates Services</em> appears to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_purpose_entity">special purpose vehicle</a> set up specifically for the Heygate contract: <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/SafeEstatesLtd.pdf">company accounts</a> show that it has no employees, pays no tax, and is a subsidiary of VPS Holdings Ltd, which is in turn a subsidiary of TDR Capital LLP.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/LapaSecurity.jpg">Further investigation reveals that <em>Safe Estates</em> has simply subcontracted the entire contract to another firm <a href="http://www.lapasecurity.co.uk/"><em>&#8216;Lapa Security Ltd&#8217;</em></a>, which is based in Swanley, Kent and which <a href="http://www.laparecruitment.co.uk/services/security-recruitment">according to its website</a> offers <strong> <em>&#8220;comprehensive security recruitment services in Orpington, Bromley, Swanley and Dartford.&#8221;</em> </strong>. <em>Lapa</em> then entrusts the Heygate contract to its self-employed security guards on zero-hour contracts. The self-employed security guards comprise one dog handler with his own vehicle and dog paid £9 per hour, and one security guard without a dog who is paid £6.30 per hour.</p>

<p>If we multiply the hourly rates by the 7x11 hour night shifts, we find that from the £13,500 per month paid by the council, less than a third is ending up in the hands of the actual contractors on the ground. The lion&#8217;s share of the contract sum is skimmed off by a number of middle men in the form of tax-avoiding holding companies and sub sub-contractors - each taking their cut.</p>

<p>The £6.30 per hour wage is also well below the London Living Wage of £8.55 per hour, to which Southwark as one of only 9 boroughs in London <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/1035/southwark_leads_the_way_on_fair_pay">committed to sign up last year</a>. It even specifically committed to extend this also to contractors and agency staff.</p>

<p>Whatsmore, on September 30th Lend Lease took possession of half of the Heygate site. Lend Lease has subcontracted the demolition of the next phase of the estate to a company called <a href="http://www.keltbray.com/"><em>Keltbray</em></a>, who have subcontracted the security of their compound to a company called <a href="http://www.clipfine.com/security.php"><em>Clipfine</em></a>. It has also emerged that <em>Clipfine</em> is failing to pay its security guards the London Living Wage, despite the fact that the Heygate planning application&#8217;s legal agreement binds Lend Lease into ensuring all its contractors and subcontractors are paid the London Living Wage<a href="See">^2</a>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/livingwage.jpg"></p>

<p>Of course this legal agreement is worthless without a council willing to enforce it, and without a council-backed investigation it is very unlikely that any subcontractors will come forward, as they run the risk of being permanently condemned to a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21155535">construction industry blacklist</a>.</p>

<p>So it looks like the Elephant regeneration is going the same way as Lend Lease&#8217;s Olympic Village development where despite all promises workers were also routinely <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/olympic-recruits-paid-less-than-london-living-wage-6525529.html">found being paid less</a> than the London Living Wage.</p>

<p>Furthermore, during the whole six-year duration of the contract, not one security guard employed by <em>Lapa</em> under the council&#8217;s contract has been a Southwark resident. So is this what Cllr Colley means by <strong> <em>&#8220;giving local people genuine opportunities to develop skills and earn a decent income&#8221;?</em> </strong>Or is it just yet another example of her administration&#8217;s propensity to make countless meaningless promises and statements?</p>

    <updated>2013-09-25T11:38:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2013/09/25/lend-lease-is-not-human</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.justice.gov.uk/__data/assets/image/0017/2960/hmcts-logo.gif">In a bizarre attempt to avoid having to disclose how much profit it will make from the Heygate redevelopment, developer Lend Lease has appealed to the Information Tribunal claiming human rights infringements.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://evacpack.co.uk/ICO.jpg" width="200" height="150"><a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/Lend_Lease_Response_to_LBS_Grounds_of_Appeal.pdf">Its appeal</a> has been made against the Information Commissioner&#8217;s <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2013/07/24/heygate-figures-must-b-be-revealed-information-commissioner/">recent ruling</a> that full financial details of its agreement with Southwark Council to redevelop the estate must be disclosed.<br/>
</br>
</br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://cf.mp-cdn.net/57/20/9677b17716a92e9257740f1b22b0-do-we-need-the-human-rights-act.jpg">
</br>
In appealing Lend Lease has cited <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/II/chapter/1">Article 1 of the Human Rights Act</a>, which states that <strong> <em>&#8220;Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest.&#8221;</em> </strong></p>

<p>Lend Lease claims that <strong> <em>&#8220;the disputed information in this case constitutes Lend Lease&#8217;s &#8216;possessions&#8217;&#8221;</em> </strong> and that <strong> <em>&#8220;disclosure would interfere with Lend Lease&#8217;s entitlement to its possessions.&#8221;</em> </strong><a href="See">^1</a></p>

<p>This desperate attempt to clutch at legal straws would be comical were it not for the fact that Lend Lease had recently spent £3m <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/07/18/regeneration-branded-miserable-failure-at-cpo-public-inquiry/">convincing the Government inspectorate</a> that it is entitled to deprive the last remaining Heygate residents of the peaceful enjoyment of their homes.</p>

<p>How in any case is the world&#8217;s largest property company - worth an estimated £3bn - able to stake a claim to any human rights one might ask?</p>

<p>Many countries prohibit a legal entity from holding human rights, unfortunately Britain is not one of them. This <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jan/28/hedge-fund-human-rights">Guardian article</a> shows that it is a growing trend in the UK, partly as an act of desperation by companies when all else fails.</p>

<p>So if Lend Lease were a person then what kind of person would it be?   Answers on a postcard please&#8230;</p>

<p>And why is it so determined to keep the Heygate financial figures secret?<br/>
Maybe because it will show how much profit it expects to make from the redevelopment, which won&#8217;t look good against what Southwark is making - or indeed losing from it. The appeal documents also show that the council has now spent a total of £65m in just emptying the estate and progressing its redevelopment<a href="See">^2</a> whilst leaked documents show that it <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/02/04/council-accidentally-publishes-confidential-regeneration-agreement/">stands to receive just £50m</a> from Lend Lease in return for the site.</p>

<p>Does anyone at the Elephant &amp; Castle other than Lend Lease still believe in this regeneration?</p>

    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2013/07/18/regeneration-branded-miserable-failure-at-cpo-public-inquiry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/IMG_3290.JPG">
Southwark’s Elephant &amp; Castle regeneration plans were branded <strong> <em>“a miserable failure”</em> </strong> by former Heygate residents at a public inquiry into the Heygate Compulsory Purchase Order.</p>

<p>The Order was confirmed today after a six month wait following the four day inquiry, which took place during 5th - 8th Feb. The inquiry was triggered when remaining leaseholders on the Heygate estate objected to the Order, which will see them dispossessed of their homes to make way for the £1.5bn regeneration scheme being undertaken by the council and its development partner <a href="http://lendlease.com">Lend Lease</a>.</p>

<p>There were a total of <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/download/8118/core_document_6-objection_table">10 objectors to the Order</a>, including the Crossway church located on the estate plus a number of local residents and community groups. The objections broached a number of themes including lack of truly affordable housing, loss of trees and claims that the <a href="http://35percent.org/">plans had been altered</a> from the <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/2004SPG.pdf">original regeneration objectives</a> to the extent that they were no longer in the public interest.</p>

<p>The objectors lead by the Heygate Leaseholders Group, pointed out that tenants on the estate had not been given the opportunity to object, as those who objected had simply been subjected to eviction proceedings under the 1985 Landlord &amp; Tenant Act. They also pointed out that the scheme amounts to forced displacement - as the council had <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">denied Heygate residents a ballot</a> on whether their homes should be demolished. Several former Heygate residents <a href="http://heygate.github.com/img/CPOWitnessStatements.zip">gave evidence</a> at the inquiry objecting to Southwark’s heavy-handed approach when the <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/HAPtenantsletter.pdf">decant was brought forward in 2007</a> - 1 in 3 secure tenants were subjected to eviction proceedings<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, and its failure to honour promises to residents that they would be able to move to new homes on the estate footprint: the new ‘affordable’ units will be at the new ‘<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/05/social-rents-increases-break-up-communities">affordable rent</a>’, which will be at least double the level of council rents. Just 1 in 5 secure tenants on the estate have managed to stay living in the SE17 postcode, the rest have been scattered across the four corners of the borough and beyond:</p>

<p><a href="http://mapsengine.google.com/map/viewer?mid=zp9B4NC378BY.kEuISBfzdwZE"><img src="http://heygate.github.io/img/DisplacedTenants.png"></a></p>

<p>The objectors were also supported by academic expert witnesses who gave evidence showing the negative effects of displacement on the community, and produced <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/tenurechangeanalysis.pdf">data</a> showing how the development plans - if passed - would create a far less mixed community at the Elephant &amp; Castle (just 8% social housing in total).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/IMG_3284.JPG" width="300" height="200">
Among the expert witnesses giving evidence were:</p>

<p><strong>Lorretta Lees</strong> - King’s College London</p>

<p><strong>Michael Edwards</strong> - Bartlett School of Planning (UCL)</p>

<p><strong>Mara Ferreri</strong> - Queen Mary University of London</p>

<p></br></p>

<p>Other witnesses giving evidence in support of the objectors included members of local groups <a href="http://betterelephant.org/">Better Elephant</a> and the <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com/">Elephant Amenity Network</a>, Catherine Croft from the Twentieth Century Society and Tim Tinker the original Heygate architect.</p>

<p>In his submission, Tinker who spent 7 years drawing up the Heygate scheme in the 1960s said the following: <strong> <em>“The Heygate and its design has been stigmatised and I thought it was time to set the record straight. Its notorious reputation is a farrago of half-truths and lies put together by people who should have known better.”</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Tinker also pointed out that the original 1970s Heygate redevelopment had been based on providing homes for those displaced from a specific <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/NewingtonEstateSlumClearanceArea.png">neighbouring slum clearance area</a> (what is now the Newington estate). The original scheme he claimed, had kept the community together whereas the current scheme he said, had seen residents <strong> <em>&#8220;scattered to the four winds&#8221;</em> </strong>.</p>

<p>Michael Edwards who is a senior lecturer in the economics of planning at UCL&#8217;s Bartlett School of Planning said <strong> <em>&#8220;What is called &#8216;regeneration&#8217; typically has perverse, unintended, negative effects of displacing precisely those people whose deprivation was taken as the justification for regeneration.&#8221;</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></p>

<p>Lorretta Lees, who is Professor of Human Geography at King’s College London and an international expert on gentrification and urban regeneration policy said<strong> <em>&#8220;The development plans do not acknowledge the social mix already present on the estate, nor do they address issues of social sustainability. They deploy a language of social balance in the service of social exclusion. The rhetoric is about social sustainability, but confirmation of the CPO will lead to social segregation.&#8221;</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/examples/helen.jpg" width="250" height="250">In her <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/examples/HelenObrien.pdf">witness statement</a>, former chair of the Heyate Tenants and Residents Association Helen O’Brien described the redevelopment plans as a miserable failure - <strong> <em>“What was once a thriving community has now been scattered all over Southwark. Southwark&#8217;s regeneration plans are a miserable failure. Everyone who has worked on the regeneration at the Elephant should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.”</em> </strong></p>

<p>During the inquiry objectors produced detailed statistics including a <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2012/12/23/1998-southwark-housing-stock-survey/">1998 Stock Condition Survey</a> and a council-commissioned <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey.html">Options Appraisal Study</a>, which had made recommendations for large parts of the estate to be refurbished as part of the redevelopment. They also produced a <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com/">detailed analysis</a> by global architects <a href="http://gensler.com/">Gensler</a>, showing how the estate could be refurbished and modernised at the current cost of just £14k per home.</p>

<p><a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf">Crime statistics</a> were also tabled by objectors in response to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87Yg_SJoPjw">council&#8217;s claim</a> that the bad design of the estate led to it becoming a <strong> <em>&#8220;by-word for social failure, crime and anti-social behaviour&#8221;</em> </strong>. The figures showed that the crime rate on the estate was a staggering 45% below the borough average.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://heygate.github.io/img/TerryRedpath.jpg" width="300" height="300">
Former Heygate Leaseholder Terry Redpath travelled in from Sidcup to give evidence at the inquiry. His submission highlighted the plight of leaseholders, many of which had been forced to relocate outside London with the low compensation paid for their homes - <strong> <em>&#8220;I could no longer afford to stay in the area - the compensation I was offered plus £45,000 of life savings bought me a terraced property 15 miles out of London. I have been forced to give up my home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors.”</em> </strong><a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> </br> Redpath, who lived on the estate for 35 years and whose family have lived in the area for generations, went on to highlight the shortcomings of the consultation process:<br/>
<strong> <em>&#8220;Consultation was a farce - the council kept insisting that 94% of local residents supported the redevelopment plans, but we later learned that this was 94% of just 6% that had responded to the survey. They had originally promised us a ballot on whether the estate should be demolished but we never got it - it has been completely undemocratic.&#8221;</em> </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?msid=206540700955382422085.0004ddeb74e646a7276ee&amp;msa=0">google overlay map</a> below shows the extent of displacement suffered by Heygate leaseholders as a result of the regeneration scheme:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/IMG_3286.JPG" width="300" height="200">
Remaining leaseholder and statutory objector Adrian Glasspool said <strong> <em>“We have simply exercised our right to say no. This is a privilege that tenants on the estate didn&#8217;t have - 198 of whom were forced to leave their homes under the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/jonabbottCPOinquiry8Feb2013.pdf">shadow of eviction proceedings.</a>&#8221;</br></br>&#8220;An entire community has been forcibly displaced for the sake of mere land value speculation.”</em> </strong>
</br>
</br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2ZJgFmnm42M/URLp52OPDEI/AAAAAAAAA9w/03rzKuUo-Js/s400/2013-02-06+10.18.46+HDR+copy.jpg">Remaining leaseholder and statutory objector Mojisola Ojeikere (left in the photograph accompanying inspector Wenda Fabian during the site tour) said <strong> <em>“We were <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/Appendix8.pdf">originally promised</a> a range of options in assisting us to buy one of the new-build Heygate homes<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>, but this promise was never honoured - now we are being shortchanged and priced out of the area: I am being offered just £150,000 for my 2 bed flat, when the new-build 2 bed Heygate flats are currently being marketed overseas for upwards of £455,000  <a href="http://www.trafalgarplace.com">[www.trafalgarplace.com]</a>. </br> How am I supposed to buy one of these with the miserable amount they are offering me for my home?”</em> </strong></p>

<p>When objectors asked at the inquiry why they didn&#8217;t get the new homes originally promised, the council&#8217;s lead officer replied <strong> <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I wasn&#8217;t employed by the council at the time the promises were made. But I am sure Lend Lease would be willing to sell to anyone&#8221;</em> </strong>:</p>

<p>Analysis of <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/LBSHeygateacquisitionsOct2012.xls">information</a> received through FOI requests, shows that the average compensation received by leaseholders for a 1 bed flat on the estate was just £95,480.</p>

<p>Southwark Council is estimated to have spent around £3m obtaining the Compulsory Purchase Order.</p>

Beyond the Council&#8217;s senior planning &amp; regeneration team officers who have defected to the private development sector, a more than significant number of Council members have also slinked through Southwark&#8217;s revolving doors:</p>

    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2013/02/04/council-accidentally-publishes-confidential-regeneration-agreement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Aclu-v-ashcroft-redacted.jpg">Southwark Council has accidentally published the details of its deal with global property giant Lend Lease for the £1.5bn regeneration of the Elephant &amp; Castle.<br/>
</br>
A redacted version of its confidential regeneration agreement was uploaded to the council’s website as part of its <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2013/02/03/heygate-objectors-to-be-heard-at-public-inquiry/">compulsory purchase proceedings</a> against remaining residents on the Heygate estate. But a classic schoolboy error has left it possible to copy and paste the blacked-out text straight out of the redacted document.</p>

<p></br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1287141619_80.177.117.97.jpg" width="300" height="200">The unintentional revelation comes after lengthy <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5869">proceedings to censure an opposition councillor</a>, who <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4879">claimed the agreement was poor value for money</a> after it was <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4712">signed in July 2010</a>. The council leader&#8217;s response at the time was that land value payments had been reduced in favour of a guarantee of 25% affordable housing. However, the recently approved Heygate plans propose just 79 social rented homes out of a total 2,535.</p>

<p>The document shockingly reveals that Southwark Council is set to receive just £50m in return for the 22 acre site (See pages 6 &amp; 10 of the Agreement – (Heygate Headlease Premium £46m + Rodney Rd. Headlease Premium £4m). Other documents show that the council has already spent £65.5m on decanting the estate and progressing the redevelopment (See paragraph 50(ix) of <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/Lend_Lease_Response_to_LBS_Grounds_of_Appeal.pdf">Lend Lease&#8217;s appeal to the Information Tribunal</a>). This means it will be making a significant loss on the redevelopment of the site. The agreement does give the council a share of overage (profit left over after the developer has taken a 20% priority slice), but a report from the District Valuer shows a viability gap such that there is unlikely to be any overage(<a href="http://planningonline.southwark.gov.uk/DocsOnline/Documents/271840_1.pdf">see para. 150-153 of Officer Report 12/AP/1092</a>).</p>

<p>Critics of the scheme are claiming that the council&#8217;s political administration has sold the Elephant short in order to gain political advantage in honouring its manifesto pledge to deliver the regeneration after years of stalled negotiations. Others are pointing towards council leader <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,26174,185,00.htm">Peter John&#8217;s cosy relationship with the global property developer</a>.</p>

<p>The £50m sale price is astonishingly low considering that the council&#8217;s own <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/CILviabilitysite11.pdf">draft CIL viability study</a> estimated a gross development value of £990m for the Heygate site, and estimated that Lend Lease stands to make a £194m profit before any overage profit is shared.</p>

<p>Comparisons with other development sites at the Elephant show that the council is receiving well below market value for its land interest:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/heygatemap.jpg">The neighbouring Oakmayne/Tribeca Square 1.5 acre development site <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/OakmayneLandRegistry.pdf">exchanged hands on the open market in 2011 for £40m</a> – just £10m below the council&#8217;s deal for its 22 acre site.</p>

<p>The regeneration agreement also discloses that there have been no conditions written in to avoid the practice of &#8216;land banking&#8217;: this is where a developer sits on an empty development site for years, which appears on its balance sheet as an asset and is used as collateral to help keep financing low for other projects. In doing so, it also profits from purchasing land when prices are low and waiting for an upturn in the market before it capitalises on its investment.</p>

<p>Lend Lease is a seasoned professional at negotiating with inept public authorities, and has a long list of white elephants in its portfolio:</p>

There was no fee, instead the Govt would <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2014020.stm">have a share in the profits</a>. However, a similarly precarious overage agreement was written up giving Lend Lease a priority £30m slice leaving little room for overage. Needless to say the Dome was sold on for £24m in 2009; the 170 acre surrounding site still hasn&#8217;t been developed; in 2012 Lend Lease sold its stake in the scheme for £100m having built just 239 of the 10,000 new homes proposed; a <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">report following a National Audit Office investigation</a> shows that there is going to be little chance of any overage.</p>

    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2013/02/03/heygate-objectors-to-be-heard-at-public-inquiry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remaining residents on the Heygate estate have submitted their objections to the Compulsory Purchase Order ahead of the forthcoming public inquiry.</p>

<p>The public inquiry has been called in order for the Secretary of State to establish whether the public benefits of the development proposals sufficiently outweigh remaining residents&#8217; rights to their homes.</p>

<p>On Tuesday 5th Feb the Heygate objectors are due to appear at a public inquiry into the Compulsory Purchase Order, which will take place at 10am at Southwark council headquarters - 160 Tooley Street, London Bridge.</p>

<p>The Heygate Leaseholders Group has issued the following statement:</p>

<p>We are glad to have been able to exercise our right to object and be heard at a public inquiry. However, it is a shame that tenants on the estate were not given the same opportunity: those who did object were simply evicted under the 1985 Housing Act.</p>

<p>Our objection is that the core public benefits of the scheme originally proposed have been dropped from the current scheme, which now resembles a purely commercial development and therefore the Compulsory Purchase Order is not valid.</p>

<p>We will be outlining the shortcomings of the current proposals, which include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the replacement of 1,100 structurally-sound social housing units with 2,300 new homes of which only 71 will be social housing;</li>
<li>the lack of any firm guarantees that any of the 400 mature trees on site will be retained;</li>
<li>the lack of any renewable energy in the proposed development;</li>
<li>the high number of parking spaces (678) and increased provision for road traffic proposed, in what is supposed to be a car-free development;</li>
<li>proposals for the new development to be controlled and managed by a private company.</li>
</ul>


<p>We will also argue that the scheme has failed to deliver its promise to Heygate residents that they would be rehoused in the new development.</p>

<p>Tim Tinker, the original Heygate estate architect will be speaking in support of our objection. He will be arguing against the council&#8217;s claim that the estate was a design failure. There will also be other local residents and professionals speaking in support of our objection.</p>

<p>We will be quoting an opinion poll which showed that despite years of underinvestment, only 29% of residents were unhappy living on the estate and a majority were in favour of its refurbishment, along with crime statistics showing that the Heygate estate&#8217;s crime rate was nearly half the borough average.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>NBA Stock Condition Survey</h2>


<p>In January 1998, Southwark Housing commissioned NBA Consortium Services to provide a comprehensive stock condition survey of its housing stock.</p>

<p>The Consortium delivered its report in May 1999. You can <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/nbasurvey1998.pdf">download a summary here.</a></p>

<iframe width="620" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://public.sheet.zoho.com/publish/adglasspool/copy-of-nbasurveyversion3-xls"> </iframe>


<p>The report showed the current condition of the council&#8217;s housing stock, and provided an estimated cost for maintenance and repairs over a successive period of 30 years.</p>

<p>It found that the average maintenance and repair cost for the entire 40,000 council-owned homes in the borough was estimated at an average of £10,653 per dwelling over 14 years and £23,363 over 30 years.</p>

<p>Top of the list was Gatebeck House in Pytchley rd, East Dulwich, which was estimated to require £147,518 per dwelling in repairs and maintenance over 30 years. This block had subisdence and was demolished in 1999. The site has since remained empty awaiting redevelopment.</p>

<p>Other buildings at the top of the list requiring substantial repairs were those on the Rockingham estate, which came in at around £40,000 - nearly double the average cost!</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Heygate estate buildings came in way down the priority list, below average at just £21,742 per dwelling over 30 years, and the Aylesbury estate slightly above average at £23,502.</p>

<h2>1998 Allot and Lomax Survey</h2>


<p>In 1998, as part of the &#39;Southwark Estates Initiative&#39;, Southwark council instructed a firm of surveyors - Allot &amp; Lomax Ltd. - to undertake a survey of the buildings on the Heygate estate, in order to get an idea of the condition of the buildings and provide cost estimates for repair/refurbishment versus demolition.</p>

<p>
    Here is a&nbsp;<a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/allot_max_survey_heygate_1998.pdf">link to the survey</a>.</p>




<p>
    Here are <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/appendices.pdf">the appendices to the survey.</a></p>




<p>
    Here are<a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/allotmax_drawings.pdf"> the drawings to the survey</a>.</p>




<p>
    The survey states that structurally the buildings are in extremely good condition. It confirms that the all the Class A (exposed and hazardous) asbestos was removed from the buildings in the late 1980&#39;s. It concludes by making recommendations against full demolition, and in favour of retaining and refurbishing parts of the estate.</p>




<p>
    The following are a few interesting extracts:</p>




<p>
    <strong>Appendix F of the Social Background Report says <em>&#39;80.3% of residients did not want to move off the estate.&#39;</em></strong></p>




<p>
    <strong>Point 4.4.4.2 says that the estate&#39;s district heating system&#39;s<em> &lsquo;boiler houses service are good and appear to be well&nbsp;maintained&rsquo;.</em></strong></p>




<div id="cke_pastebin">
    <strong>Point 4.8.3.1 says that <em>&#39;generally the buildings and walkways are in generally good condition&nbsp;given their age but need a programme of maintenance given the &lsquo;years of neglect&rsquo;.&nbsp;</em></strong></div>


<p></br></p>

<p>
    <strong><em>&quot;The crime statistics show a very low crime rate for this estate.&quot;</em>(page 25)</strong></p>




<p>
    <strong><em>&quot;The age profile of the estate shows a higher proportion of elderly residents than the borough norm: 20% compared with a borough-wide figure of 13%.&quot;</em>(page 26)</strong></p>




<p>
    <strong><em>&quot;Many of the residents on the Heygate estate have lived on the estate since its construction 25 years ago, and many have lived in the locality all their lives.&nbsp;We would strongly stress, therefore, that the council retains the Wingrave site so that many of the long-standing residents can remain in the immediate locality.&quot;</em> (page 64)</strong></p>




<p>
    <strong><em>&quot;There is a large number of residents, mainly elderly, who have resided on the estate for a number of years and have extensive links with the local E&amp;C area, and who have a reluctance to consider relocating elsewhere in the borough.&quot;</em> (page 26)</strong></p>




<p>
    <strong><em>&quot;In conclusion we believe that option 6 (partial demolition of tall blocks &amp; retention of maisonettes) provides the best solution. It is not only the most cost-effective solution but will lead to an overall development which will be environmentally, architecturally and socially appropriate to take the Heygate into the new millenium.&quot;</em>(page 64)&nbsp;</strong></p>




<h2>Recent Gensler Survey</h2>


<p>Despite the fact that <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/strategic24June.pdf">Council papers</a> show that repair works have been deferred on the Heygate since as early as 1998, <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">this recently completed study</a> by global consulting firm <a href="http://www.gensler.com">Gensler</a> shows that the Heygate buildings are still in good condition and could be fully refurbished for just £13,955 per home.</p>

<h2>So Why Demolition?</h2>


<p>This prompts the question as to why they are being demolished?</p>

<p>Southwark Council has given five different justifications for demolition:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/strategic24June.pdf"><em>&#8220;an ugly and polluted environment and an unrecognised economic potential.&#8221;</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/305/demolition_begins_on_heygate_estate"><em>&#8220;bad design of its stairwells led to crime and anti-social behaviour.&#8221;</em></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19371334">The estate is being demolished because it is <em>&#8220;unpopular social housing.&#8221;</em></a></p></li>
<li><p>Along with the shopping centre it is one of <em>&#8220;two big large structures preventing the E&amp;C from prospering from its location.&#8221;</em>:</p></li>
</ul>


<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_F08Ty9x7lE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<ul>
<li>The estate had become a by-word for social failure, crime and anti-social behaviour:</li>
</ul>


<iframe width="400" height="225" src="http://betterelephant.github.com//www.youtube.com/embed/87Yg_SJoPjw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>With the survey information above and <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/HeygateCrimeStats.pdf">crime statistics</a> showing the Heygate’s crime rate at around 50% below the borough average, there is clearly little evidence to support the claims that the Heygate estate failed. These unfounded claims serve simply to reinforce the council &amp; developer-led agenda which is based entirely on financial gain.</p>

    <link href="http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/12/07/has-southwark-done-a-bum-deal-at-the-elephant/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-07T11:31:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/12/07/has-southwark-done-a-bum-deal-at-the-elephant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://images.2ue.com.au/2010/03/10/1209561/Barangaroo_11-600x400.jpg" width="300" height="200">It emerged this week that Southwark Council&#8217;s development partner and global property giant &#8216;Lend Lease&#8217;, is being <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/valuation-dispute-poses-threat-to-1b-return-from-barangaroo-20121206-2ay9e.html">taken to court by state authorities</a> in Sydney over expected land payments for its Barangaroo development.</p>

<p>Taxpayers were originally promised that land value and $1bn AUS dollars in public spending necessary to assemble the site, would be paid back to the state government once the project is completed. This was part of the &#8216;profit-share&#8217; or &#8216;overage&#8217; agreement signed when the plans were drawn up. However, Lend Lease is now disputing how the land should be valued once construction has been completed.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/elephant_backside_shadow.png">This doesn&#8217;t bode well for Southwark taxpayers, who have already forked out <a href="http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/documents/s14567/Appendix%201%20-%20Regeneration%20spending%20detailed%20breakdown.pdf">at least £38m</a> in emptying the Heygate estate, and are about to put their hands in their pockets for a further <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SNJuly2012.jpg">£15m to pay for its demolition</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/Appendix_8.pdf">this report</a> from the council&#8217;s Finance Director in 2007, the deal with Lend Lease involves them reimbursing £20m towards the £32m cost of buying out the leaseholders on the Heygate, £20m towards demolition costs, and a fixed payment for the land of £10m.</p>

<p>So the council is set to receive a total of £50m reimbursement for site assembly, once the Heygate site has been cleared and handed over to Lend Lease - [by which time the council is likely to have spent nearly twice this amount on the task]. The rest of the money the council is expecting to receive from the deal is based on a &#8216;profit share&#8217; agreement, otherwise known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-sale_overage">&#8216;overage&#8217;</a>. However, it is important to understand that this 50% share of the profits comes only AFTER Lend Lease has taken a 20% &#8216;priority share&#8217; of the profits and a 4% management fee.</p>

<p>So it remains to be seen whether there will be anything left for the council at all in 2026 when the Heygate development is due to be completed.</p>

<p>These &#8216;profit share&#8217; or &#8216;overage&#8217; agreements are notoriously precarious, and can be subject to disputes over accounting methods as we are seeing now with Lend Lease&#8217;s Barangaroo development. They can also be compromised by delays to development, such as with Lend Lease&#8217;s Greenwich Peninsula scheme where the profit share expected from the scheme by authorities fell by £30m for each year the scheme was delayed. <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">(National Audit Office Report – 14 July 2008)</a></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/viabilityminutes.png" width="250" height="550">Exactly how much Southwark council is currently expecting to recoup from the profit-share agreement at the Elephant is unclear, as it has <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2012/07/03/its-all-about-financial-viability/">rejected all calls</a> to publish any financial details relating to the development.</p>

<p>If the expected profit share is not enough to cover the costs it has incurred in emptying the estate, and the money it will have to cough up for the tube station capacity upgrade to support the new development, then it could end up making a substantial loss on the disposal of its 24-acre primely located Heygate site.<br/>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
The council currently <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/AssetManagementPlan.pdf">values its portfolio</a> of 39,000 residential properties at £954.7 per square metre (GIA - Gross Internal Area). At around a total (GIA) of 100,000 square metres, the 1,200 homes on the Heygate represent an asset to the council worth around £100m. So, even if you were to discount the development value of the land, the council should be expecting to recoup at least £220m in overage if it is going to break even and cover its costs from this development(£70m site assembly/£100m existing use value/£50m tube station capacity upgrade).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/CILviabilitysite11.pdf">2012 BNP Paribas site viability appraisal</a> of the Heygate development estimates gross profits at £194m. However, the appraisal doesn&#8217;t include the site assembly or infrastructure costs - these are expected to be around £120m. If we include these and subtract the developer&#8217;s 20% priority slice of the profits, then the whole scheme goes into the red and is set to make a whopping £90m loss!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5314">Suggestions</a> have also been made that the current deal with Lend Lease is a breach of EU competition Law.

    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/12/03/gensler-heygate-refurbishment-proposal</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/images/20khouse_02.gif">In April 2012, Building Trust International launched the <a href="http://www.buildingtrustinternational.org/homecompetition.html">HOME competition</a> - a project focused on providing residents most at risk in developed cities with a safe place to live. The competition&#8217;s task was to create an urban dwelling for under £20k, and it resulted in over 450 applications.</p>

<p>One of the applications was an entry from <a href="http://www.gensler.com/">Gensler</a>, a global architecture consulting firm. Gensler produced a detailed report showing how it could be possible to refurbish the Heygate estate for just £14,000 per unit - costing in total less than half of what it has already cost just to empty the estate.</p>

<p>At the beginning of November, we contacted Gensler who gave us permission to display one of its presentation slides on the Better Elephant website. However, last week Gensler contacted Better Elephant to request the presentation slide to be taken back down.</p>

<p>Being just marginally above the £13,000 grant available under the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/ourwork/empty-homes">HCA Empty Homes Grants Programme</a>, one can see why the <a href="http://heygateestate.wordpress.com">Gensler proposals</a> are interesting for community-led regeneration schemes like Better Elephant, and we were dissapointed to have had to remove the Gensler Heygate slides.</p>

<p>Gensler, were recently <a href="http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/design-team-named-for-olympic-international-quarter/8625976.article">selected by Lend Lease</a> to help design its new £1.3 billion commercial district on the edge of the Olympic Park in Stratford City.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/12/1352720042109/homeless1.jpg" width="400" height="300">The Gensler Heygate entry won an honourable mention, but the winner of the competition was architect consultancy Levitt Bernstein with its <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2012/nov/12/garages-housing-homeless-people">&#8216;pop-up&#8217; garage proposal</a> which would allow an 11.5sq m bedsit to be created within a disused garage for around £13,000. <br/>
</br>
With over 1,000 garages on the Heygate estate this would double the number of homes on the site without any structural modifications. We wonder if Levitt Bernstein will be putting forward this proposal in <a href="http://www.levittbernstein.co.uk/architecture/housing/totters-court">its masterplan</a> for the forthcoming Aylesbury estate regeneration..</p>

    <updated>2012-11-16T11:23:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/11/16/better-elephant-lodges-formal-application-with-secretary-of-state</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Better Elephant has made a formal application to the Secretary of State under the new <a href="http://www.emptyhomes.com/what-you-can-do-2/resources/prods-2/">Community Right to Reclaim Land powers</a>. The community-led regeneration group is requesting that the Heygate estate is released from its current contractual deadlock and put back into use.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2010/11/dzn_Heygate-Abstracted-by-Simon-Kennedy-1.jpg" width="300" height="400">The Secretary of State can order public authorities to dispose of empty property or land. The powers are part of wider developments under the new Localism Act, which aims to shift the balance of power away from the centre to local communities.</p>

<p>The Community Right to Reclaim Land allows anyone to request that a specific area of publicly-owned land is put up for sale on the open market.</p>

<p>This can be on grounds that there are no suitable development plans in place or likely to be put in place in an acceptable period of time.</p>

<p>The Better Elephant Group are arguing that the current development plans for the Heygate estate are not going to be implemented in an accetable period of time [completion not due until 2026].</p>

<p>The group claims that this is a &#8216;land banking&#8217; exercise conducted by developers, which enables them to use the land as a long-term asset to shore-up their balance sheets. According to <a href="http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/8421/we-must-fix-it-delivering-reform-of-the-building-sector-to-meet-the-uks-housing-and-economic-challenges">a recent IPPR report</a> this is common practice among the big developers, and there are currently 170,000 homes in London with planning permission that are not under construction.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/oakmayne.jpg">The Heygate&#8217;s neighbouring Oakmayne/Tribeca development is one such example where planning permission was granted for over 500 homes due to be completed by 2009. The site is still standing empty behind a wall of decaying wooden hoarding. <br/>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
The &#8216;land banking&#8217; practice also enables developers to drip-feed the market: it slowly releases its flats for sale - keeping prices high and avoiding flooding the market.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/el19_921.jpg">The effect on surrounding communities is devastating: 170 businesses are currently on the verge of bankruptcy according to business support network <a href="http://bizextra.biz/about">&#8216;Business Extra&#8217;</a> on Walworth rd. Such practices drive out retailers and lead to long term blight of an area.</p>

<p>The delay is also a waste of public funds in the loss of rent and council tax incurred by the council.</p>

<p>It also cuts into the council&#8217;s expected returns from the regeneration partnership: because the council&#8217;s return for its land interest is based entirely on overage (profit after the developer has sold the new homes and taken a priority share), delay to the housing development erodes the financial returns, since the present value of future income is lower when received later in time compared to income received earlier, because of the time value of money and the greater risks involved.</p>

<p>This was also the finding of a <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">National Audit Office report</a>, when an investigation was launched after questions were raised about the Lend Lease Greenwich Peninsula regeneration deal in 2008.</p>

<p>Better Elephant&#8217;s refurbishment plans will be facilitated by a Community Land Trust, which is not profit driven and will oversee the refurbishment of the buildings to ensure a more equitable revitalisation of the Elephant &amp; Castle without waiting another 15 years.</p>

<p>We have also applied for a slice of the <a href="http://www.insidehousing.co.uk/repairs/minister-invites-bids-for-%C2%A3300m-empty-homes-fund/6524789.article">recently announced £300m Empty Homes Fund</a> designed to &#8216;stop the rot&#8217; and bring empty homes back into use.</p>

    <link href="http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/11/08/heygate-leaseholders-submit-their-objections/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-08T08:58:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/11/08/heygate-leaseholders-submit-their-objections</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19371334">served with a Compulsory Purchase Order</a> by Southwark Council, Heygate leaseholders have fought back by submitting an objection to the Secretary of State. You can <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/HeygateCPOStatementOfCaseFinal.pdf">view the objection here</a>. What the objection basically says is that the regeneration scheme originally promised a number of <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5430">significant public infrastructure improvements</a>, that these have been dropped and that the scheme now resembles a purely commercial development. Therefore CPO powers are not appropriate as there are no public benefits to the scheme.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://southwarknotes.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/418865_406280396101674_377969546_n.jpg?w=500&h=333" width="400" height="300">The Council&#8217;s original &#8216;Statement of Reasons&#8217; in which it makes the case for the CPO can be <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/what-s-the-deal-peter.html">downloaded here.</a>  The document makes interesting reading.</p>

<p>The leaseholders group are currently in the process of organising their &#8216;Statement of Case&#8217; against the CPO. This will also be published online once it has been submitted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the group have published their objections to the planning application for the Heygate redevelopment:</p>

<p><strong>Objection to revised Heygate Outline Planning Application - 12/AP/1092</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Affordable Housing -</strong>
Whilst the new revised housing statement does now include a minimum target of 25% affordable housing, it is not proposing the type of affordable housing required by planning policy or negotiated in the Regeneration Agreement. Both the local planning policy and the Regeneration Agreement state clearly that half of all affordable housing must be social rented. This is not the case with this application which has substituted the new ‘affordable rent’ tenure in its place. These new ‘affordable rents’ are anything but affordable and are beyond the means of most of our former neighbours here on the Heygate estate. As a result there will be insufficient social-rented homes in the new development for Southwark to be able to honour its promise to rehouse former Heygate residents in the new homes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the planning application makes no provision for the retained equity homes which it was originally agreed would be offered to Heygate leaseholders like ourselves. The result is that we are being priced out of our community and that we have been asked to give up our homes on the back of promises which have not been kept. Only a limited number of former Heygate tenants will now be able to return; the exact number is unclear, but phase one of the Heygate development provides an indicator where the detailed application has now been submitted for 235 new homes, only 8 of which will be social rented.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/gatedcommunity.png" width="350" height="493">This is an insult to the 3,500 former Heygate community who were told they would be able to return to new homes on the site. It will result in the creation of a private gated community for the wealthy, and will lead to further segregation between the capital’s ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’. This is further exacerbated by the <a href="http://affordable.heroku.com/blog/2012/07/04/londons-largest-new-private-park-in-70-years/">planning application’s Estate Management Strategy</a>, which proposes that the entire 10 hectare footprint comes under the control of a privately-managed ‘Estate Management Company’ patrolled by a private ‘Town Centre Security Team’.</p>

<p></br>
</br>
</br>
<strong>2. Sustainability -</strong>
The Elephant &amp; Castle&#8217;s existing Energy Centre used to supply heating &amp; hot water to homes on both the Heygate and neighbouring Salisbury Row estates and a housing development on Rodney Road.</p>

<p><img src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/HeygateDHN.png"></p>

<p>Up until January 2011, the regeneration masterplan promised to replace this with an Energy Centre which would supply up to 10,000 homes in the entire E&amp;C area with renewable energy. This was part of the ambitious ‘zero carbon’ growth initiative endorsed by Bill Clinton.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M9H_K3msMSc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>However, this strategy now appears to have been abandoned in its entirety: the outline planning application makes no commitment to any renewable energy whatsoever. It proposes a replacement district heating network significantly smaller than the existing one, which supplies only those homes included in this planning application. It fails to make a firm commitment to supply any new homes on the first phase of the Heygate redevelopment or any other developments in the area; moreover there will be insufficient capacity to do so.</p>

<p>Whilst there are two energy efficient Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants proposed within the Energy Centre they will be of relatively small capacity (1248 kW in total), and CHP will only be meet half of the total heating requirements of the new development. The other half will be met by good old-fashioned gas boilers.</p>

<p>Biomethane gas would make this a greener option but the supply is still in doubt. It won&#8217;t be produced on-site or off-site by Lend Lease. The gas will come from the national grid but will be paid for at a premium: a bit like green tariff electricity. Whether you will actually be able to get biomethane will depend on whether there is enough being injected into the grid. There are currently no operational biomethane plants injecting into the UK gas grid. Despite this, Lend Lease claim that there is a possibility that 15% of the gas supply could be supplied by biomethane by 2020.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/energy9.png" width="400" height="400">It is also a surprise to learn that there is no guarantee that the new Energy Centre will be connected to the Phase 1 development. The separate Phase 1 application proposes having its own separate Energy Centre - again reliant on gas boilers with CHP providing just half of its total heating requirements. The outline planning application also optimistically lists 14 other sites including Phase 1 that could &#8216;possibly&#8217; be linked at some future date. But this would only be possible by installing significant extra plant. However, questions still remain as to whether there is enough room in the Energy Centre for extra plant and who would pay for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"><img src="http://www.bdunlop.com/images/Elephant-and-Castle/energy_envrnmtl-services_lge.gif"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/2270">The fabled &#8216;MUSCo&#8217;</a> was going to provide 10,000 homes with renewable energy. It was a pioneering scheme endorsed by Bill Clinton as a global example of &#8216;carbon zero&#8217; development. The ambitious plans proposed a biomass CHP plant generating green heat and power from organic waste. It was also going to provide a bore-hole for a green water supply and an automated vacuum waste collection system moving municipal waste through underground tunnels.</p>

<p>Now it would appear that Lend Lease have submitted applications which barely connect one side of the estate with the other.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/aerial.png"> <strong>Tree Strategy</strong>-</p>

<p>The planning application’s Tree Strategy is equally ambiguous and non committal. Whilst it identifies a number of trees for &#8216;possible retention&#8217;, the application&#8217;s small print contains the following caveat: “As many of the best of the existing mature trees will be retained where possible” subject to ‘further more detailed testing” at later design stages.
The application therefore makes no firm commitment to retain any of the 400 mature trees on the existing site.</p>

<p><strong>3. Transport -</strong>
In the past two and a half years, nearly 300 people have been killed or injured on the roads in and around the Elephant &amp; Castle. Since Christmas 2011, 4 pedestrians have died including most recently a 5 year old boy. The danger to all but most clearly to pedestrians and cyclists is endemic and long standing, owing to the domination of the area by vehicle traffic.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/imageuploads/1311085254_80.177.117.97.jpg">The original regeneration plans included proposals to tackle this problem by creating a pedestrianised ‘Civic Square’, which would span across the Northern roundabout connecting the two tube stations and creat a pedestrian precinct.
The Northern roundabout is officially the most dangerous traffic interchange for cyclists in London and cannot be crossed by pedestrians without negotiating a labyrinth of subways.</p>

<p>However, the final masterplan application now appears to have dropped all plans to reduce car domination: the civic square has been shelved, and it is actually proposing to reduce the size of the roundabout in order to increase the width of the vehicle traffic lanes: “Part of the overall central island removed within the vicinity of access for the electricity substation to accommodate improved circulation and better lane discipline on the internal gyratory, with amendments also along the eastern side to better accommodate the full five lanes” (Section 11: pg. 104)</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://affordable.heroku.com/images/cyclebypass.png">In addition, - despite strong objections from City Hall - the application proposes to block TFL’s plans for a much needed eastern cycle bypass as part of the proposed Cycle Superhighway 6 (Penge to the City):</p>

<p>“A route for the new cycle superhighway (CS6) is not intended to be provided through the proposed Development. At the heart of the Proposed development is the provision of a new Park, a place for people to visit and enjoy as a leisure activity. The Proposed development is therefore designed to support leisure cyclists rather than being used as a cycling commuter route through the development which may discourage less confident cyclists and conflict with pedestrian movement.” (Transport Statement - 6.8.2)</p>

<p>Thus, not only is the application proposing to widen the E&amp;C roundabout to provide an extra lane of vehicle traffic, it is also opposing plans for a much-needed cycle bypass avoiding a key collision blackspot.</p>

<p>Beyond this it is also planning to create 678 new parking spaces at the Elephant: “The Development will provide a maximum of 616 car parking spaces. A maximum of 62 car parking spaces could be provided on street.” (Transport Statement -15.1.2) This is a breach of planning policy, entirely unnecessary in a zone 1 public transport hub, and wholly incompatible with claims of delivering a car-free sustainable development.</p>

<p><strong>4. Timescale -</strong>
The planning application proposes that the development will be built in phases and will not be fully completed until 2026. The original Heygate development was completed in 1974 and took just 4 years to complete. The delay is unacceptable and will lead to long-term blight affecting residents and businesses in the area. The reasons for the delay are commercial rather than technical and are based on well-established speculative &#8216;land banking&#8217; practices employed by developers. The long delay allows the developer to benefit from speculative land value increases, and is also used to shore up its balance sheet with the land appearing in its accounts as an asset. This increases its credit ratings and lowers its borrowing costs on other projects.
The applicant&#8217;s track record here is an unforunate sign of what is likely to befall the Elephant if this planning application is approved:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In 2001 it signed a Regeneration Agreement for 150 acres of land at Greenwich Peninsula.</p></li>
<li><p>An anxious political administration is forced to make significant concessions on planning obligations in the 3 years before outline planning is finally granted in 2004.</p></li>
<li><p>8 years pass without any development whatsoever until Lend Lease sells the land in June 2012 to Hong Kong developer &#8216;Knight Dragon&#8217;. This site remains undeveloped.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, the estimated profit share expected to be clawed back from the scheme by the Authorities falls by around £30m for each year the scheme is further delayed. <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0708/greenwich_peninsula.aspx">(National Audit Office Report – 14 July 2008)</a></p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 1968, the decision was taken to demolish the original tenement buildings and owner-occupied terraced housing to make way for the Heygate estate.</p>

<p>The reasons given for the redevelopment were the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The main problems to be overcome are the replacement of densely populated and obsolete tenement buildings which have low environmental standards, with redevelopment in a manner commensurate with today&#8217;s needs and standards.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Paragraph 2.2.1</strong><cite>1968 Heygate Estate Planning Brief</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>It has since been accepted that the victorian buildings were structurally sound and that they would be very sought after today had they been retained:</p>

<p>In April 2011, Southwark council acknowledged the Heygate estate buildings were structurally sound, and released the following press statement in justifying its demolition:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Much has been learned since the designs of the 1960s. As time has passed, the estate has become increasingly expensive to maintain and heat and is no longer an ideal place for people to live compared with standards that are expected today.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Southwark Council</strong><cite>Press Release April 2011</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Now questions are being asked as to why did <a href="http://heygate.herokuapp.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey.html">80.3% of its residents say that they didn&#8217;t want to move off the estate</a>if it was not an ideal place for people to live?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Following last year&#8217;s attempts by Southwark Council to <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/unauthorised_activities.pdf">prosecute remaining residents</a> involved in Better Elephant&#8217;s interim use programme, this year Better Elephant decided to create a pop-up cinema which can be popped up and then quickly popped down again.</p>




<p style="text-align: center; ">
    <img alt="Heygate Pop-up Cinema" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/heygate_cinema.JPG" style="width: 400px; height: 300px; " /></p>


<p>Around 50 people attended the opening night of the &#39;pop-up&#39; cinema last Saturday 22 Sep, for the premiere&nbsp;screening of the film <a href="http://youtu.be/CnkVzJXibyI">&#8216;Doreen&#8217;</a> made by film-makers David Reeve &amp; Patrick Steel.</p>

<p>In the film, Doreen Gee - former Chair of the Tenants &amp; Residents Association - reminisces about the culture of the estate and what went wrong with the regeneration.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.org/images/heygate_cinema2.JPG" width="400" height="300">The evening was curated by Jerry Flynn, former estate resident and local campaigner (<a href="http://35percent.org/">www.35percent.org</a>). Doreen and both of the film-makers attended the event, which was followed by an animated discussion around the regeneration and wider housing issues. The audience included a number of former Heygate residents and residents from the neighbouring Aylesbury estate, who were treated to a bowl of hot soup and refreshments following the lively discussion.</p>

<p>
    During the discussion, Doreen - who had originally been a strong propenent of the regeneration - spoke about the broken promises of new homes for residents of the estate and how many were forced into unsuitable accommodation much further afield. She also claimed she had been victimised after speaking out against the regeneration.</p>




<p>
    The film was accompanied by a number of newsclips about the estate and an excerpt from the film-makers&rsquo; new feature-length documentary about the regeneration of the estate (Larry &amp; Janet). Film-makers David Reeve and Patrick Steel from <a href="http://kingchainproductions.com/">Kingchain Productions</a> have been filming on the estate since the decant started, and have inspired the confidence of residents past and present. They are due to release a feature length documentary about the estate in Autumn 2013.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Three days after the event, four council officers turned up - including <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/08/06/offensive-graffiti-removed/">Graffiti afficionado Andrew Ashaye</a> - to deliver the notice pictured below. </p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://alicecalcagno.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_9857-2.jpg" width="400" height="300">Fortunately, the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/space">Better Elephant group</a> was able to hastily pop-down the pop-up cinema on Wednesday evening before any harm came to it. The cinema will now be &#39;popped up&#39; on an ad-hoc unannounced basis when it is least expected. The next film to be screened is Michael Wadleigh&#39;s 1981 film - &#39;Wolfen&#39;: a cautionary metaphor about real estate speculation, urban gentrification, homeless displacement and all the disturbing human-caused destruction that threatens people&rsquo;s communities and the ecosystems we all share.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://alicecalcagno.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dsc_9696.jpg" width="400" height="300">Meanwhile, &#8216;developer-compliant&#8217; interim uses on other parts of the estate continue with the council&#39;s full backing: <a href="http://elefest.org/">Elefest&#39;s annual festival</a> is set to take place on the estate during 5th, 6th and 7th October. This marks the opening of the Heygate&#39;s new &#39;Hotel Elephant&#39; - an art space funded by development-partner Lend Lease, in which some of the asbestos-riddled former community facilities on the estate are being converted to swanky artist studios. Now that the feckless undesirables have been removed from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19371334">&#8216;unpopular social housing&#8217; estate</a>, the drab interiors of the former community centre are being converted to plush artist studios for a far more deserving new gentrified community. &nbsp;</p></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.elefest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/flame-classic.jpg" width="400" height="300">Providing that none of the contractors come down with asbestos poisoning from the refitting works, the studios&#39;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elefest.org/event/hotel-elephant-launch/">will open on the 6th October with</a> a performance by a wasteful gas-powered firebreathing robotic dragon.</br> Welcome to London&#39;s greenest regeneration scheme&#8230;</p>

<img class="right" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/mrstilki.jpg" width="400" height="300">Meanwhile two of the remaining households on the estate - about to be <a href="http://heygate.github.io/displacement.html">forcibly displaced</a> - include pensioners in their seventies &amp; eighties. Since the council <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,19279,185,00.htm">switched their heating off</a> in 2010, the Mustafa family and the Tilki family have been sat at home covered in blankets huddled around a portable electric fan heater - whilst artists and revellers gather around the spectacle of a fire-breathing dragon in the estate&#8217;s former community hall. </br>Welcome to London&#8217;s least equitable regeneration scheme and most brazen example of Gentrification in action.&nbsp;

    <updated>2012-08-06T12:50:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://betterelephant.github.com/blog/2012/08/06/offensive-graffiti-removed</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    In its fear that <a href="http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=richard-reynolds-3556/">olympic torch bearer Richard Reynolds</a> might take an unscheduled detour through the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/space/">Better Elephant community gardens on the Heygate estate</a>, last week Southwark Council safely removed an offensive piece of graffiti by <a href="http://www.philaretordre.blogspot.co.uk/">Belgian street artist - &#39;Homme aux Crayons&#39;</a> (Pencil Man).</p>




<p>
    We know that this regeneration scheme has been using a <a href="http://35percent.org/">substantial amount of greenwash</a> to cover its underlying intent. But its greenwash techniques took on a different meaning this week as Council Officer Andrew Ashaye directed a team contractors to wash over the artworks with a thin coat of green paint:</p>




<p style="text-align: center;">
    <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uqPKcfTH_zQ" width="420"></iframe></p>




<p>
    However, we think that the contractors must have suffered a bout of workplace fatigue: as once they had finished removing the artworks in the <a href="http://betterelephant.org/space/">community gardens area</a> of the empty estate they packed up their rollers and left. None of the graffiti anywhere else on the 24 acre estate was painted over. Indeed, what is more puzzling is that this comes after two years of not having carried out any basic estate cleaning and maintenance. The estate has been <a href="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/img_2391.jpg?w=595">full of fly-tipped tyres and asbestos</a> since 2009 and suddenly the Council turns up to remove six pieces of quality street art?&nbsp;</p>




<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img alt="Heygate estate Chopsticks art work" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/ChopsticksBefore.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 158px; " /><img alt="Heygate estate street art Chopsticks after removal by Southwark Council" src="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/ChopsticksAfter.jpg" style="width: 200px; height: 157px; " /></p>




<p>
    The Council has a procedural system for graffiti on its buildings awaiting demolition: anything deemed offensive is removed and non-offensive graffiti is left in place. However, the procedures for deciding what is offensive and to whom are not so clear..</p>


<p><img class="left" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5040/6949483456_93c4be341f.jpg"> In <a href="http://serge-louis.blogspot.co.uk/">a recent interview</a> the &#39;Homme aux Crayons&#39; talks about his work and how he is inviting traditional graffiti artists to change their ways: <em>&quot;They always write the same old letters and I am trying to persuade them to <strong>add a little character and change their form of expression</strong>. I too have a recurring element in my work - pencils, but each time the pencils are a little different. I start out each time with a pencil but then I modify and play with it. I am trying to help them realise that they can change something whilst at the same time retaining a recurring element.&quot;</em></p>

<p></br></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://halag.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/andrewashayesouthwarkcouncil.png" width="400" height="300">After the council&#8217;s numerous <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/images/unauthorised_activities.pdf">attempts to stifle</a> Better Elephant&#8217;s interim use strategy for the estate, we are beginning to think that there might be a recurring element here too. So Mr. Ashaye, next time you visit the Better Elephant community gardens flexing your muscles on council business - please <strong>add a little character and change your expression!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>
    UPDATE(02/09/12): Three weeks on from the graffiti greenwash incident - Mr Ashaye has commissioned street artist &#8216;Gold Peg&#8217; <a href="http://heygate.github.io/img/releasethewolves.pdf">London&#39;s largest street-art graffiti artwork</a> on the Heygate estate as part of the <a href="http://releasethewolves.org/">&#39;Release the Wolves&#39;</a> Go-karting event!</p>

<p>
    Clearly Mr Ashaye has had a sudden change of heart and embraced the graffiti artists!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46360829@N03/7313520106/in/photostream/lightbox/"><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7075/7313520106_a0e646d99b_m.jpg"></a><a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/l/lesserspottedwoodpecker/index.aspx">The lesser spotted woodpecker</a> is the smallest and least common of the three woodpeckers that are resident in Britain, and is an extremely rare sight in central London.</p>

<p>The sighting follows on from the recent revelation that bats are roosting in the empty buildings on the estate:</p>

Along with the resident hens and bees, the Better Elephant scheme is seeing the Elephant &amp; Castle&#8217;s biodiversity index raised to unprecedented levels.</p>
