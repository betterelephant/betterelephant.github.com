    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://londonist.com/2012/02/heygate-estate-residents-rebuff-lend-lease-masterplan.php"><img class="right" src="http://d4k7s9ho8qact.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/DSC03794-300x237.jpg?9d7bd4" title="&#34;Photo: Sam Frankl&#34;" alt="&#34;Photo: Sam Frankl&#34;"></a> Contrary to this &#8216;For Sale&#8217; sign erected by a confused local estate agent, the Heygate is not for sale. The Heygate estate was already <a href="http://www.southwark.gov.uk/news/article/193/elephant_regeneration_agreement_formally_signed">sold by Southwark council on Friday 23rd July 2010</a> to an Australian company called &#8216;Lend Lease&#8217;. Perhaps this is why Southwark council was so quick to remove the &#8216;For Sale&#8217; sign, in order to avoid a rush of enquiries from people wishing to buy a home on the Heygate.- Although I think there might still be a <a href="http://halag.wordpress.com">couple of leaseholders</a> on the Heygate still willing to sell up..<a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6820425150_77a0988bc7_z.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7038/6820425150_77a0988bc7_m.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The details of the agreement, i.e. the sale price have not been disclosed by Southwark council. It is claiming that the sale price is &#8216;commercially sensitive&#8217; information and therefore cannot be made public. One of the opposition councillors disagreed with this decision and tried to make some of the details public. She was quickly silenced when the labour administration <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/5869">took legal action to have her censured</a>. This is the first time in the history of Southwark council that a councillor has been censured. One might be forgiven for asking why the council are so keen to avoid the details of its deal with Lend Lease entering the public realm? Could it be something to do with Lend Lease&#8217;s track record for securing public handouts?:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Comments on the Final Masterplan - Poverty of Process</h2>

<p>The deadline for comments on the final masterplan passed yesterday. The <a href="http://elephantamenity.wordpress.com">Elephant Amenity Network (EAN)</a> is a coalition of local groups and people that includes council tenants, leaseholders, shopkeepers, market traders and community groups. Since July 2011, members of the EAN have been actively engaging with the consultation process, which was set up by developers &#8216;Lend Lease&#8217; who employed a PR company called &#8216;Soundings&#8217; to manage it. Now that the consultation has ended, members of the EAN group have expressed their frustration at the shortcomings of the process. Here are some of the feedback comments made by members of the group:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I decided there was little point in providing another detailed submission. 90% of the comments I made in July 2011 (exhibition 1) and October 2011 (exhibition 2) have not been responded to at all, let alone realised in terms of any significant changes to the masterplan. My 1st contact with Soundings was to ask whether they thought the principles of neighbourhood planning and the Localism Act were relevant to their work at the Elephant and Castle. I never received an answer.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Richard Lee</strong><cite>EAN Member & Local Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><strong>EAN&#8217;s criticisms of the masterplan included the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Insufficient affordable and social housing</li>
<li>The ‘affordable’ housing which is due to be provided is anything but affordable <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/SouthwarkTargetRents.pdf">(1-bed social-rented units starting at £275 per week!)</a></li>
<li>Too few family-size homes</li>
<li>Over-provision of parking spaces, completely unnecessary in a public transport hub</li>
<li>No Local and sustainable food production (allotments and permaculture)</li>
<li>No Recognition of natural habitats</li>
<li>No 20 mph speed limit zones</li>
<li>No reference to schools, GP’s, community managed and owned amenities</li>
<li>No teenage play and youth provision</li>
<li>No Local jobs target (How can we ensure that any of the jobs created will go to local people?)</li>
<li>No London Living Wage guarantee (How are we to ensure that any of the jobs created will pay a reasonable wage?)</li>
<li>No Working with voluntary and community sector employment/training providers (How can we ensure that local people can receive the training to take up the the new jobs?)</li>
<li>No Procurement policies that support local providers (How are we to ensure that contracts go to local businesses?)</li>
<li>No Support for existing local independent retail (How are we to ensure that existing local retailers are not priced out of the area by high st. chain stores?)</li>
<li>No guarantee of a fully accessible public realm (How can we ensure that the new public park will be truly public and accessible to all if privately owned?)</li>
<li>No provision of existing buildings for interim use (empty existing buildings could be put to use during the 15 years that the development is estimated to take)</li>
<li>No provision to maintain public access through all sites (The Heygate estate&#8217;s 25 acres of land is set to be enclosed by a fence for the next 15 years)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Noise-</strong> The new layout is connected and permeable, but it will open the centre of the site to noise and pollution from the Elephant&#8217;s major roads. At present, the Heygate&#8217;s perimeter blocks act as a very effective barrier to the noise and pollution from the Walworth &amp; New Kent roads. The new layout does nothing to address this issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7066/6815836156_2d4417b1fa_z.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7066/6815836156_2d4417b1fa_m.jpg"></a><strong>The park-</strong> The park is very narrow in relation to its length. It would appear that the park has been positioned according to the <a href="http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4142">serpentine viewing corridor</a>, along a narrow east-to-west strip which is entirely encapsulated by high-rise blocks. The obvious disadvantage is that the park will be entirely overshadowed by the new buildings on its Southern border, and is likely to end up becoming London&#8217;s first ever park to be built permanently in the shade.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/pictures/636x441fitpad[237]/1/3/8/1716138_1675_02_Print_5k_Final_180212.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcREjcrkoZcKIk2My6TXbFHpiXLcImCw4pQFsiDkMWQvBS1RVR0Ng-R5"></a>The exhibition models in the final masterplan exhibition were misleading: the high-rise buildings surrounding the park were shown in Perspex on the exhibition model, which neatly avoided any true sense of enclosure; light perspectives on most of the visual imagery provided at the exhibition were incorrectly represented- one of the computer-generated images showed the midday sun shining from the North East!</p>

<p>Despite numerous concerns about the publicness of the new public park, this area has also been left in the dark. The local community have been pressing without avail to have arrangements here formalised, in order to avoid the ‘privatised public space’ model – places like More London or New Street Square, where security guards pounce on subversive activities like picnics or photography. The EAN are calling for the park to be officially adopted by Southwark council, in order to protect it legally in perpetuity as public open space and to ensure that public interests are upheld.</p>

<p><strong>Sustainability-</strong><br/>
The question of sustainability in the masterplan approach, is of course predicated on the premise that the site must be completely redeveloped [and not innovatively and – possibly - more sustainably refurbished as a prototype for the future]. None of the questionnaires have ever allowed for this response, answers to the limited questions about priorities have been interpreted to assume that all respondents agree to wholesale redevelopment.</p>

<p>Concerns raised about the negative carbon impact of the scheme from this perspective have gone entirely unheeded:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I attended the sustainability workshop on 15th December. During the workshop, I suggested the provision of independent evidence on the potential CO2 implications of the redevelopment project, which includes the analysis of embodied carbon in the current buildings on the Heygate estate, plus the estimated carbon footprint of the new development. Lend Lease&#8217;s representative agreed to provide these once the masterplan had been finalised. <br/>When the minutes of the sustainability workshop were finally circulated by Soundings - two months later on 13th February - the minutes failed to include my suggestion and Lend Lease&#8217;s agreement to the carbon analysis. I contacted Soundings to request that the meetings minutes were updated to include the analysis, and despite numerous follow-up emails I have still had no response.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>A Glasspool</strong><cite>EAN Member & Heygate Estate Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/6963713367_960d357bdb_b.jpg"><img class="left" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/6963713367_960d357bdb_m.jpg"></a>The <a href="http://www.elephantandcastle.org.uk/download,93,sustainability.pdf">exhibition board for sustainability</a> at the final masterplan exhibition stated the following objectives:
 <strong>‘Social aim – to deliver a genuinely mixed-use neighbourhood, as an integral part of a wider regenerated area, for all ages, backgrounds and means.’</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is patent nonsense – people of all ages, backgrounds and means cannot afford to stay at the Elephant, given the very low proportion of social rented and really affordable housing.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Annie Lennox</strong><cite>EAN Member & Local Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is an insult to myself and the rest of the 3,000-strong community on the Heygate, who have been strong-armed and intimidated out of their homes, and will now remain permanently priced out of the area.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>A Glasspool</strong><cite>EAN Member & Heygate Estate Resident</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p><a href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7195/6963708953_48767ec1df_b.jpg"><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7195/6963708953_48767ec1df_m.jpg"></a><strong>Trees-</strong>
The exhibition board for Landscape &amp; Trees shows removed trees only as small red dots, which is a graphic technique aimed at playing down the impact of tree felling. Moreover, the display is wholly inaccurate: a large number of existing trees are not depicted on the map whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>General-</strong>On a general level, the final masterplan exhibition refers to material that will be submitted, in a few weeks, as part of the outline planning application. This includes the amount of floorspace per use, the environmental impact assessment, access and landscaping statements and some 16 other supporting documents.</p>

<p>Yet the exhibition largely restricted itself to colourful bite-size displays and non-specific statements. A huge amount of new material will suddenly emerge with the planning application, which could and should have been covered in the public exhibition.</p>

<p>Local residents have had no opportunity to input into these documents, there have been no panels, no cooperative survey work, no sharing of frameworks, let alone a collaborative approach to the production of documents.</p>

Over 100 people turned out in the spring-like sunshine, to view our <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/introductionneighbourplanning">neighbourhood planning</a> proposal for an alternative regeneration plan. The exhibition is a response to the current masterplan for the area, which was released to the public last week, and which offers an alternative vision of regeneration at the Elephant &amp; Castle.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7065/6934528309_8e7a3918b7_m.jpg">We are proposing amongst other things to retain some of the family homes on the Heygate estate, and reinstate some of the original proposals from the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/82420796/Southwark-Council-2004-Development-Framework">2004 masterplan</a>, i.e. the civic square and the MUSCo (Multi-Utility Services Company).
After the success of the event, we are planning to leave the exhibition&#8217;s display boards up for a further two weeks until 15th March.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7198/6791800232_2f39a4a174_m.jpg">Spring was in the air for the Heygate&#8217;s mobile gardeners too. They were out in force preparing for the coming growing season, and inviting other local residents to get involved. The group have begun planting herbs and vegetables in old recycling containers in various location throughout the disused housing estate. Any local residents who are interested in starting their own mobile gardens are <a href="http://betterelephant.org/space">invited to get involved</a>.</p>
