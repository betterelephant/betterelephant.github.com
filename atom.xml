    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7183/6934528321_ec11c8611e_m.jpg">The sun was shining on our <a href="http://betterelephant.org/images/BetterElephantFlyer.png">Better Elephant exhibition</a> at the Heygate estate on Saturday. Over 100 people turned out in the spring-like sunshine, to view our <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/introductionneighbourplanning">neighbourhood planning</a> proposal for an alternative regeneration plan. The exhibition is a response to the current masterplan for the area, which was released to the public last week, and which offers an alternative vision for the Elephant &amp; Castle&#8217;s East Walworth area.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7065/6934528309_8e7a3918b7_m.jpg">
Our exhibition discussed proposals including the following areas of local interest:</p>

<ul>
<li>East Street Market</li>
<li>Green Spaces &amp; Links</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>Locally Listed Buildings</li>
<li>Retail &amp; Employment</li>
<li>Meanwhile Spaces</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="left" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7198/6791800232_2f39a4a174_m.jpg">Better Elephant&#8217;s <a href="http://betterelephant.github.com/space">&#8216;Meanwhile Spaces&#8217; group</a> where also proud to showcase their ideas for making use of empty spaces on the estate for community gardening activities. They were out in force preparing for the coming growing season, and inviting other local residents to get involved. The group have begun planting herbs and vegetables in old recycling containers in various location throughout the disused housing estate. Any local residents who are interested in starting their own mobile gardens are <a href="http://betterelephant.org/space">invited to get involved</a>.</p>

<p>After the success of the event, the exhibition&#8217;s display boards will remain in place providing a hub for further information and consultation.</p>
