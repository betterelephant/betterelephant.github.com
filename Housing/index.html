<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/21699743?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="200" height="112" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Page 82 of a council-commissioned <a href="http://heygate.heroku.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey">survey of the Heygate estate</a> states that:
<em>&#8216;Many of the residents on the Heygate estate have lived on the estate since its construction 25 years ago, and many have lived in the locality all their lives.&#8217;</em></p>

<p>It goes on to make recommendations against full demolition because <em>‘The social effect of the above would be to completely break up the Heygate community’.</em></p>

<p>Southwark council chose to ignore the recommendations of its own report, and began &#8216;decanting&#8217; the estate in 2007. By the end of 2008, most of the estate&#8217;s residents had been disbanded throughout the borough by forcing them through the bidding procedure for existing council stock. The Heygate&#8217;s residents were given a &#8216;right to return&#8217; to the Elephant &amp; Castle- but with a number of restrictions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The right to return does not apply to the developments planned for the Heygate footprint itself. It only pertains to the so-called &#8216;early housing sites&#8217;- Only three of which have been completed to date.</p></li>
<li><p>Validity of only 7 years&#8230;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Needless to say that only 147 residents have signed up to it..</p>

<p>This forced displacement of a community is a clear violation of human rights law:<em>&#8220;forcible transfer of population&#8221;</em> is defined as a crime against humanity by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Article 7).</p>

<p>And a violation of the 1976 Race Relations Act. Indeed, the E&amp;C regeneration scheme has already been <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2005/dec/15/regeneration.communities">referred to the Commission for Racial Equality</a>.</p>

<p>Despite having been declared structurally sound in a <a href="http://heygate.heroku.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey">survey commissioned by the council</a>, the current regeneration scheme plans to demolish the 1,212 spacious but neglected council homes on the Heygate estate, and replace them with 2,500 new &#8216;city appartments&#8217;. Only 12.5% of the new homes planned to be built are designated for social-rented accommodation, and it is still not clear if these will classed under the new &#8216;affordable rent&#8217; category (80% of market rent).</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/4/15/1302853280112/Heygate-estate-in-south-L-007.jpg" title="Heygate Estate" ></p>

<p>This is significantly below the requirements set out by Southwark council’s own planning policy, and the <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan">London Plan</a> framework for new developments in the capital. This is a net loss of nearly 1,000 social rented homes at a time when they are most needed (19,000 families currently on Southwark&#8217;s housing list). It will serve only to exacerbate the hardship resulting from the current economic crisis, and will result in the existing community being priced out of their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In addition only 10% of the new homes built are due to be family homes (3-bedroom). The rest are set to be small 1 or 2 bedroom studio flats, which - if the Strata Tower is anything to go by - will be bought up by investment companies on a buy-to-let basis.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.estatesgazette.com/blogs/london-residential-research/assets_c/2010/10/strata_tower_elephant-thumb-200x268-95865.jpg" title="Strata Tower" ></p>

<p>We don&#8217;t believe that this will create a &#8216;sustainable community&#8217;, just a transitory population of tenants with little commitment to the area or their neighbours.
The <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan">London Plan</a> requires that a minimum of 35% of all new housing built in London is social-rented accommodation. It also requires 40% of these to be 4 bedroom units or larger.</p>

<p>The current plans are therefore in breach of the requirements set out by the London-wide planning policy. Southwark council has attempted to circumvent this by producing a get-out clause in its local planning policy [E&amp;C SPD]. However, this document is breach of national planning policy because it failed to consult&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>Better Elephant</strong> plans to retain and refurbish all of the family-size housing units on the Heygate estate by purchasing them under the &#8216;Community Right to Buy&#8217; introduced by the new Localism Act.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7022/6505667691_f329fbb768.jpg">There have already been a number of <a href="http://www.nissankejones.com/heygateestate.html">imaginative proposals</a> for refurbishing the estate, and altering buildings for alternative use (ie. converting garages to artist studios/workshops etc.). Similar schemes in other locations - like the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/25/park-hill-sheffield-landmark-revamp">Park Hill estate in Sheffield</a> have proven to be a resounding success.</p>

 Examples are all around of the miserable, yet grinning regeneration tat that awaits. Across the road from the Heygate is a nasty block clad in Trespa, a thin, tinny material used to make concrete frames enclosing tiny flats look bright and shiny; nearby is Strata, a flashy tower with three non-functional wind turbines at the top, aimed squarely at the luxury market. As against the Heygate&#8217;s unfashionable simplicity, it&#8217;s a building that takes the Bruce Grobbelaar approach to design: making the easy – a tall tower of apartments – look fiendishly difficult; a cluttered and clumsy design that was the deserved winner of Building Design&#8217;s Carbuncle Cup award for the worst building constructed in 2010. The Heygate, harsh as it may seem, treats its residents as adults and serves a much-needed social function: keeping low-income families in the centre of London. The regeneration that aims to erase it is marked by the infantile, jolly aesthetic that so often accompanies acts of class-cleansing today.</p>
