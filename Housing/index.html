<p>Despite having been declared structurally sound in a <a href="http://heygate.heroku.com/monthly-roundup/1998-allot-and-max-survey">survey commissioned by the council</a>, the current regeneration scheme plans to demolish the 1,212 spacious but neglected council homes on the Heygate estate, and replace them with 2,500 new &#8216;city appartments&#8217;. Only 12.5% of the new homes planned to be built are designated to be social-rented accommodation.</p>

<p>This is significantly below the requirements set out by Southwark council’s own planning policy, and the <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan">London Plan</a> framework for new developments in the capital. This is a net loss of nearly 1,000 social rented homes at a time when they are most needed (19,000 families currently on Southwark&#8217;s housing list). It will serve only to exacerbate the hardship resulting from the current economic crisis, and will result in the existing community being priced out of their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In addition only 10% of the new homes built are due to be family homes (3-bedroom). The rest are set to be small 1 or 2 bedroom studio flats, which - if the Strata Tower is anything to go by - will be bought up by investment companies on a buy-to-let basis.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t believe that this will create a &#8216;sustainable community&#8217;, just a transitory population of tenants with little commitment to the area or their neighbours.
The <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/londonplan">London Plan</a> requires that a minimum of 35% of all new housing built in London is social-rented accommodation. It also requires 40% of these to be 4 bedroom units or larger.</p>

<p>Moreover, the demolition of the Heygate estate would cost the council millions of pounds at a time when it has seen a cut to its budget of 25%. We believe these funds can be better deployed elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Better Elephant</strong> is considering proposals to retain and refurbish most of the family-size housing units on the Heygate estate by purchasing them under the &#8216;Community Right to Buy&#8217; introduced by the new Localism Act.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7022/6505667691_f329fbb768.jpg">There have already been a number of <a href="http://www.nissankejones.com/heygateestate.html">imaginative proposals</a> for refurbishing the estate, and altering buildings for alternative use (ie. converting garages to artist studios/workshops etc.). Similar schemes in other locations - like the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/25/park-hill-sheffield-landmark-revamp">Park Hill estate in Sheffield</a> have proven to be a resounding success.</p>

 Examples are all around of the miserable, yet grinning regeneration tat that awaits. Across the road from the Heygate is a nasty block clad in Trespa, a thin, tinny material used to make concrete frames enclosing tiny flats look bright and shiny; nearby is Strata, a flashy tower with three non-functional wind turbines at the top, aimed squarely at the luxury market. As against the Heygate&#8217;s unfashionable simplicity, it&#8217;s a building that takes the Bruce Grobbelaar approach to design: making the easy – a tall tower of apartments – look fiendishly difficult; a cluttered and clumsy design that was the deserved winner of Building Design&#8217;s Carbuncle Cup award for the worst building constructed in 2010. The Heygate, harsh as it may seem, treats its residents as adults and serves a much-needed social function: keeping low-income families in the centre of London. The regeneration that aims to erase it is marked by the infantile, jolly aesthetic that so often accompanies acts of class-cleansing today.</p>
